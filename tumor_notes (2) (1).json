Patient is status post L2 kyphoplasty and spine tumor  radiofrequency ablation.    COMPARISON:  06/10/2021 lumbar spine MR.    TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images were performed through the lumbar spine with multiplanar  reformatted images generated. . technical protocol was utilized.  Dosimetry: CTDIvol:  7.22 MGy; DLP:  234.3 MGy-cm (Note: These dose indicators  do not reflect the effective patient dose, but are metrics based on  standardized CT phantoms. The effective dose may vary widely depending on body  size, shape, and other patient factors).    Dose reduction was performed with automated exposure control, iterative  reconstruction technique and/or adjustment of the mA and/or kV for patient  size.    FINDINGS:  L2 pathologic fracture with expansile lytic lesion extending through the left  posterior elements and into the left ileo psoas musculature.  Bone cement is  well dispersed within the L2 vertebral body.  There is persistent retropulsion  resulting in moderate central canal stenosis at the L2 level.  There is no  evidence of epidural extension of bone cement.    Moderate to severe multilevel degenerative disc disease with grade 1  anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and L5/S1 endplate degenerative changes.    IMPRESSION:  1. Status post L2 kyphoplasty with bone cement well dispersed within the L2  vertebral body.  Destructive lytic lesion extends through the left posterior  elements and into the left ileo psoas musculature.  Resulting severe left  foraminal narrowing at L2 with likely impingement on the exiting left L2 nerve.    Signed by: ***** ***** MD 06/26/2021 6:31 PM  Dictation workstation:   MGH-*****  \"\n"},

Then on sotorasib but developed progression, very painful L2 vertebral body metastasis for which he is s/p palliative RT and kyphoplasty, followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel. Then progressed and now on gemcitabine.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  - August 2020: CXR performed to work up cough revealed a RUL consolidation  - 09/30/2020 CT chest: 2.9 cm RUL mass with extensive mediastinal and right supraclavicular adenopathy.  - 10/07/2020 PET/CT: FDG uptake in 2.8 RUL mass, uptake in hilar, bilateral mediastinal nodes and right supraclavicular adenopathy, uptake in left axillary lymph nodes. Low level uptake in healing left lateral 10th rib fracture, and low level uptake and subtle sclerosis of L4 vertebral body.   - 10/14/2020: Biopsy of right supraclavicular LN                Path: poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma               IHC: TTF-1 and napsin negative, CK7+, *****+, PD-L1 0% (TPS <1%)               ***** NGS: ***** *****, TMB-high (11 *****/mb), ***** p.194R, MS-S               Negative for actionable mutations in *****, *****, EGFR, *****, *****, NTRK May 24/3.

Discussed with radiology, and the most accessible area is likely the right supraclavicular lymph node, which has nearly doubled in size and is superficial. Discussed getting this at *****, but Dr. ***** can arrange in ***** with their interventional radiology group, so will cancel the order for UCSF. The biopsy should be sent for path to confirm histology and also ideally for NGS to help guide treatment.     - Discussed plan with Dr. *****  - Continue gemcitabine locally in *****  - ***** gemcitabine will be held tomorrow for mucositis   - Other SoC options down the line: pemetrexed   - Recommend repeat biopsy of right supraclavicular lymph node locally in *****; send tissue for path and NGS to help guide treatment options   - Phase I referral placed previously, Mr ***** will schedule an appointment when he feels ready   - Immunotherapy contraindicated given history of life-threatening ***** (myocarditis, myositis)   - CT c/a/p scan locally in 6 to 8 weeks after starting therapy (plus MRI brain at *****)     #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. He is s/p GK on 03/03/2021 to one parietal lesion and also lesion in L hippocampus. Brain MRI on 06/10/2021 shows no new or enlarging intracranial mets.   - MRI brain every 3 months or so; need to be coordinated around PPM. Due now; he will follow up about scheduling with radiology.      #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x7. Given progressive lung cancer, no more abatacept doses are currently planned. Continue ***** 30 mg without further tapering until Troponin T normalizes. At this point, Trop-I normalized and Trop-T downtrending. ***** take time to rebuild cardiac muscle.  - Permanently discontinued checkpoint \"\ninhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology for further monitoring and management.  - Further doses of abatacept on hold for now in light of cancer progression   -Continue prednisone 30 mg/day  -He is no longer using the CPAP machine   -Continue trending Troponin T  -Cardiac MRI is pending    #Bone metastases  Agree with starting zolendronic acid rather than alendronate for tolerability. This will be done locally in ***** after dental clearance.     #Severe back pain  L2 metastasis caused severe pain that was difficult to manage and escalating quickly. Appreciate involvement of his local team for management.  -Continue regimen of APAP, methadone, oxycodone per his local team  -Finally some improvement in severe symptoms after kyphoplasty, radiation   -Tapered off gabapentin    #Edema  Low threshold to get bilateral extremity ultrasound to r/o DVT. However, since also present in upper extremities, thrombosis seems less likely. September just reflect all the extra fluid he received with the procedure last week and chemo, in setting of low albumin. Other possibilities to consider if worsens are heart failure, or adenopathy impairing venous drainage.    - Consider further w/u if persists (DVT ultrasound, *****, ***** c/a/p)     #Immune-related myositis  Predominant symptom was bulbar weakness, although he also had more subtle widespread muscle weakness. Confirmed on EMG from 01/23/2021. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams. Continue prolonged steroid taper. He is down to prednisone 30 mg/day, will hold of on tapering further until troponin T normalizes.   - Follow up with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - Continue prednisone 30 mg/day for now until Troponin T normalizes  - PT/OT, vision therapy   - Check with Dr. ***** about booster      #Immune-related hepatitis  Resolved with steroids.  - CTM     #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer \"\nstaging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Neuro angiography without evidence of recurrence in May 2021    #Low appetite  Continue ensure./boost nutritional supplements.

Infiltrative soft tissue in the right paratracheal region has increased in density, which may reflect development of calcification. These findings likely reflect evolving posttreatment sequela. Unchanged ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe measuring 1.5 cm most suspicious for synchronous adenocarcinoma spectrum lesion. ***** in a/p.   -04/07/2021: Abatacept #6  -05/04/2021: Abatacept #7  -05/27/2021 CT c/a/p: Evidence of worsening malignancy including enlarging heterogeneously enhancing right upper lobe mass, right supraclavicular lymph node and mediastinal nodal conglomerate. Increased right upper lobe interlobular septal thickening may represent lymphatic spread of disease or lymphatic obstruction. Enlarging soft tissue mass in the right paraspinal musculature concerning for soft tissue metastasis. New small right pleural effusion of unclear etiology. Unchanged persistent ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe which may represent a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma lesion. New mixed lytic and sclerotic L2 vertebral body metastasis with a new expansile lytic component/soft tissue mass which invades the left psoas muscle and demonstrate significant mass effect on the thecal sac this measures approximately 4.8 x 3.4 cm  -06/10/2021 MRI L spine/brain: No new or enlarging intracranial metastasis. Evidence of treated \"\nprior intracranial metastasis. L2 vertebral body metastasis with pathologic compression fracture, involvement of the left psoas muscle, and epidural extension of metastasis resulting in mild spinal canal narrowing and severe right neuroforaminal narrowing. Additional small T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense lesions are present within the L3 and S2 vertebral bodies and are incompletely evaluated due to the absence of IV contrast and could reflect additional sites of metastases  -06/16/2021-06/18/2021: RT to L2 metastasis  -06/21/2021: Stopped sotorasib  -06/22/2021: C1 carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly start  -06/26/2021: Kyphoplasty, which took away some of the deep shooting pain.   -06/29/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -07/27/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -08/03/2021:carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -08/10/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -08/17/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly  -08/24/2021 CT c/a/p: Similar size of treated right upper lobe mass, with interval development of presumed postradiation scarring within the paramediastinal bilateral upper lobes. Increased soft tissue thickening adjacent to mass along the right upper hilum, with new obstruction of a traversing segmental right upper lobe  bronchus. Findings could also reflect evolving post radiation effects; however, close follow-up imaging is recommended. Increased moderate right pleural effusion. Increased size of supraclavicular and mediastinal masses. Decreased intensity of peripheral ***** of enhancement noted, although this may simply reflect differences in contrast bolus timing. Likely occluded right internal jugular vein. Redemonstrated L2 pathologic fracture, status post cement augmentation, with interval increased height loss at L2 and now L1 compared to 06/26/2021. Thickened segment of nondilated bowel in the central abdomen, nonspecific, and possibly reflecting *****, though treatment effects are also possible if there is history of \"\nradiation to this vicinity.   UCSF overread: Compared to 05/27/2021, significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as new or enlarging right paraspinal intramuscular masses. Findings are concerning for worsening metastatic disease. No significant change in right upper lobe mass however with increased architectural distortion, volume loss, and reticulation in the upper lobes anteriorly and *****. Findings are favored to represent postradiation change, recommend correlation with patient treatment history. Compared to 05/27/2021 interval pathologic compression fracture of the L2 vertebral body, with additional compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body as described above. Sclerosis within the L1 vertebral body may reflect sequela of mechanical adjacent segment fracture or an additional underlying osseous metastasis. Patient is status post vertebroplasty at these levels, with significant focal kyphosis and osseous narrowing of the spinal canal. The extraosseous component of tumor at L2 is significantly reduced in size from the prior exam, no longer conspicuous. No findings suspicious for new metastasis within the abdomen or pelvis.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology, ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB 11 *****/mb), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed growth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He tolerated treatment well without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy showed a partial initial response. Primary tumor was ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. However, he developed severe lower back pain in late April, and restaging CT c/a/p in 05/27/2021 confirmed significant worsening metastatic disease, with an increase in size of RUL primary tumor, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a new 4.6 cm L2 vertebral body osseous metastasis. He has now \"\nundergone palliative RT to the spine, kyphoplasty for severe ongoing back pain, and is now s/p 6 cycles of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel chemo, all locally up in *****. I've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Unfortunately, restaging CT c/a/p from 08/24/2021 showed cancer progression, in particular in the right supraclavicular lymph node, mediastinal lymph nodes, and a paraspinal intramuscular metastasis. I think there's been enough progression to merit a change in therapy, in particular because symptom-wise he is feeling worse too. We discussed several standard of care treatment options. He had only one cycle of pemetrexed-based therapy at the time of diagnosis, so could revisit pemetrexed now. Advantages are tolerability and also it has some CNS penetration. However, only appropriate for adenocarcinoma histology. Gemcitabine is another very reasonable option, and ultimately this is what we decided to use next; likely to be tolerable with weekly dosing and has activity in both adenocarcinoma and squamous histologies (and we have never fully pinned down his NSCLC histology). Discussed with Dr. ***** and he's now been started on gemcitabine. Restaging scans after 6 to 8 weeks of therapy to assess initial response; these can be done locally per his preference. MRI brain with routine scans, at least every 3 months; due now, scheduling pending here at *****, need to coordinate around pacemaker with radiology. Unfortunately we do not have any good trial options within our thoracic group; he would not qualify for immunotherapy-based combinations given life-threatening ***** history.

CONSENT:  The patient and/or their family was given a full and complete explanation of the procedure including the risks of stroke, death, hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, vascular injury which includes vessel perforation, vessel dissection, vessel occlusion, groin puncture site bleeding complications, allergic reaction to contrast material, femoral nerve damage at the groin puncture site, hemorrhagic transformation of a stroke, thrombolic or embolic events, alopecia, blindness, visual field deficit, kidney damage, need for emergent surgery as well as other unforeseeable complications together with the potential benefits and alternatives. The patient and/or their family fully consented to undergo this procedure. PROCEDURE ***** *****:     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neurovascular operating room suite and placed supine on the angiography table. Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Monitored Anesthesia Care was provided by the UCSF Department of Anesthesia throughout the procedure.  Local anesthesia with September 30 cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine in the subcuticular and subcutaneous tissues of the left  inguinal region around the left  common femoral artery. An 11 blade was used to make a small \"\nskin incision at the groin puncture site. A 19 gauge single wall needle was used to puncture the left  common femoral artery. Upon brisk return of arterial blood, a 0.035 inch ***** guidewire was advanced through the needle into the left  common femoral artery. The needle was removed and a 5 French vascular sheath inserted over the guidewire into the left common femoral artery. The guidewire and dilator were removed and the sheath double flushed with heparinized saline solution. The sheath was sewn in place with 2-0 ***** and perfused with heparinized saline for the remainder of the procedure. Left common femoral artery angiography was performed by injecting 6 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 6 ***** centimeters of non-ionic contrast through the sheath giving approximately 20 digitally acquired angiographic images in the contralateral oblique projection. Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 5 F UCSF 2 diagnostic catheter was advanced through the abdominal and thoracic aorta over a ***** guidewire. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the right common carotid artery over the Terumo guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the ***** and Lateral projections using 1 separate injections of 5 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 7 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the right internal carotid artery over the Terumo guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  *****/lateral projections using  1 \"\nseparate injections of 5 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 7 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the right external carotid artery over the Terumo guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  ***** and Lateral projections using 1 separate injections of 2 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 4 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the left external carotid artery over the Terumo guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  ***** and Lateral projections using 1 separate injections of 2 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 4 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the left common carotid artery over the Terumo guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the *****/lateral projections using 1 separate injections of 7  ***** centimeters per second for a total of 9 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. The catheter was removed from the patient's body. Hemostasis in the left groin was achieved after removal of the \"\ngroin sheath by AngioSeal. No iatrogenic complications resulted from this procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Due to the technical difficulty of performing this complex procedure, additional physicians were required. SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  None.

INTERPRETATION OF FILMS:    FINDINGS: Selective injection of the sheath accessing the left common femoral artery with the camera position over the pelvis demonstrates expected appearance of the external iliac, common femoral, and profunda femoris arteries without evidence of access related complication. Selective injection of the right common carotid artery with the camera positioned over the neck demonstrates an expected appearance of the carotid bifurcation as well as cervical internal and proximal branches of the external carotid arteries. Selective injection of the right internal carotid artery with the camera positioned over the head demonstrates expected appearance of the petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the ***** as well as ipsilateral MCA and ***** branches.  There is no evidence of aneurysm, arterial-venous shunting, or other pathological \"\nvascular anomaly.  Selective injection of the right external carotid artery with the camera positioned over the face and head demonstrates  an expected appearance of the external carotid and its branches without evidence of arterial-venous fistula or other pathological vascular anomaly. Selective injection of the left external carotid artery with the camera positioned over the face and head demonstrates an expected appearance of the external carotid and its branches without evidence of arterial-venous fistula or other pathological vascular anomaly. Selective injection of the left common carotid artery with the camera positioned over the neck demonstrates  expected appearance of the petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the ***** as well as ipsilateral MCA and ***** branches.  There is no evidence of aneurysm, arterial-venous shunting, or other pathological vascular anomaly.     1. No evidence residual arteriovenous shunting or ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistula.

History of Present Illness:    ***** ***** ***** is a ***** y/o man with h/o stage IV lung adenocarcinoma s/p cycle 1 of carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab c/b ***** myocarditis and hepatitis requiring steroids and abatacept x3, nodal block s/p PPM, ethmoid dural AVM s/p embolization, R IJ thrombotic occlusion on eliquis, s/p ***** UCSF admission for progressive bulbar and ***** weakness that began in November and thought  ***** myositis.  Patient presents for discharge follow up regarding myositis.    Patient initially presented to UCSF on 12/12/2020 \"for elective management of high risk ethmoidal dural AVF and was found to have elevated LFTs and trop/CK elevations, with EKG showing intermittent complete heart block. He was biopsy diagnosed with ***** myocarditis, s/p 5 days of pulse dose steroids and 3 injections of abatacept, as well as MICRA AV pacemaker placement December 18 for complete heart block. After his heart condition was stabilized, he was seen by neurosurgery and received embolization of his AVM on December 20 with follow up procedure December 25, with successful treatment of his AVM. He then returned to the cardiology service to finalize management of his ***** myocarditis.\"  He was placed on prednisone 100mg every day from December 20 - January 01 and then placed on steroid taper.    Of note prior to the 12/12/2020 admission the patient reports that he did have double vision.  From January 2021 Discharge Summary: \"He was seen by neurology at that time who recommended LP at that time but was not completed; AChR, ***** and VGCC returned negative.\"     02/11/2021 Neurology Admission:     \"Symptoms initially started with binocular diplopia that improved in the afternoon (and without fatigability), which has progressed, along \"\nwith L ptosis, facial weakness, dysarthria and dysphagia. Reports no weakness in arms/legs. He was initially on ***** December 15-December 19 then with taper, now on prednisone 45 mg every day.\"     \"Initial concern on admission was for a myositis or myasthenia in the setting of pembrolizumab, or subarachnoid space process in the setting of his underlying malignancy. His CK was normal on admission. During this hospitalization, he underwent MRI brain/orbit w/w/o contrast that revealed two new brain metastases for which Radiation Oncology was consulted and his outpatient oncologist was informed. He underwent an EMG/NCS on 01/23/21, showing increased fibrillations and positive sharp waves in right delt/biceps/TA, increased incidence of small amplitude and short duration units in right delt/biceps brachii and early recruitment in the right delt/biceps brachii, supportive of myopathic process with active denervation. For this, reason, he was started on ***** x5 doses with plan for LP...He underwent two lumbar punctures (01/27/21 and 01/28/21); first lumbar puncture with zero WBC, zero RBC, prot 38, glu 73; second lumbar puncture with zero WBC, 13 RBC, prot 39, glu 88 (serum 127).\"     \"Given history and exam without typical features, and negative AchR and *****, MG was felt less likely. Given concern for pembrolizumab-related ***** myositis and very low suspicion for MG (including evidence of tolerance to steroids without worsening on high doses), he was started on ***** 1 gram daily for 5 days followed by prednisone taper (see below)...He had symptom improvement with ***** and given his improvement IVIg was deferred.  He was evaluated by OT/ST, who recommended discharge home with outpatient OT and dysphagia diet.\"  He demonstrated mild improvement in his bulbar symptoms at the time of discharge.     Interval History:    The patient is currently taking Prednisone 50mg and is two days from ***** to 40mg.    Since discharge the patient \"\nreports slight improvement in his speech, swallowing and overall strength.  He is able to go upstairs, walk 20 minutes on level ground and is doing low weight./high rep resistance training at home.  He practices Aikido at home.  He still has a lot of fatigue.  He denies numbness/tinging.  He denies falls.  He does not require the use of a cane or walker.  He denies issues with urination and bowel movements.    He is planning to start PT, *****, SLP.

Occlusive thrombus in right internal jugular vein, secondary to mass effects from right supraclavicular adenopathy.    - 11/20/2020 CT chest: Interval increase in size of masses within the RUL. Unchanged additional GGOs and solid nodule in *****. Worsening mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. Diffuse right chest wall subcutaneous edema.   - 11/23/2020 MRI brain: incidental 2.5 x 1 cm aneurysm of posterior communicating artery, no intracranial metastases.   Developed rapidly enlarging right supraclavicular LN conglomerate, as well as enlarged upper mediastinal lymph nodes, with resulting narrowing of the airways and an occlusive thrombus in the RIJ secondary to mass effect, for which radiation was initiated.   - 11/22/2020-11/22/2020: initial RT, 600 cGy in 2 fr to R supraclavicular *****  - 11/26/2020-11/28/2020: IMRT to supraclavicular node, mediastinal disease, and primary tumor, 800 cGy in 4 fr  - 12/02/2020-12/12/2020: IMRT accelerated given planned NSG procedure, 2500 cGy given in 10 fr   - 12/13/2021-01/01/2021: Admitted for planned elective management of ethmoid dural AVM, but found to have elevated LFTs and trop/CK elevations on admission, complete heart block, ultimately diagnosed with ***** myocarditis (biopsy-diagnosed) and hepatitis, s/p 5 days of pulse dose steroids and 3 injections of abatacept, as well as ***** ***** pacemaker placement for CHB.    -12/16/2020 CT chest: Compared with 11/20/2020, decreased size of RUL mass and right upper mediastinal/supraclavicular LAD Decreased mass effect on right brachiocephalic and right subclavian veins compared to prior. Chronic thrombosis of right IJ. Unchanged partially calcified anterior \"\nmediastinal soft tissue density may reflect metastatic LN vs thymoma given neurologic symptoms.   -12/16/2020 MRI brain: Punctate acute infarct within the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere. High risk right ethmoid dural AV fistula.   -12/30/2020 CT angiogram brain/neck: Asymmetric filling of the left cavernous sinus on CTA phase may reflect residual arteriovenous shunting. Relative narrowing of the right A1 segment compared to MRI of brain performed on 11/26/2020, which may reflect differences in technique versus vasospasm. Redemonstrated RUL mass grossly unchanged compared to 12/16/2020.  -01/20/2021 Cardiology follow up: troponin *****, recommend dose #4 abatacept while weaning steroids.  -01/20/2021 UCSF pathology review of OSH biopsies:    Right supraclavicular LN: metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, most likely NSCLC, possibly adenosquamous carcinoma. IHC: TTF-1 (-), Napsin A (-), PD-L1 <1%; ***** (-), CK7 (+), P63 (+)   Left axillary LN:  Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. IHC: P16 (-), *****/6 (+), CK7 (+), GATA3 (-), TTF-1 (-), Napsin A (-), mucicarmine (-); P63 (+), ***** (-), ***** (-)  -01/23/2021-01/28/2021 UCSF admission: Sent to the ER with persistent bulbar weakness with *****, ptosis, voice changes, dysphagia, tongue weakness. EMG on 01/23/2021 consistent with myositis. Treated with ***** x5 doses, abatacept #4 on 01/24/2021. Discharged on prednisone 60 mg with plans for taper.   -01/23/2021 MRI brain: two punctate foci of enhancement in bilateral parietal lobes, new compared with 12/16/2020, suspicious for metastases. No acute abnormality of the orbits or signal abnormality of CN III, IV, or VI.  -01/23/2021 CT c/a/p: Compared to 12/16/2020, decreased mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy as well as right anterior mediastinal soft tissue thickening. However, slight interval increase in size of the right upper lobe mass now measuring 2.9 cm (previously 2.3 x 2.1). Chronic thrombosis/stenosis of \"\nright internal jugular vein.     -January 28 and 01/28/2021 LPs: CSF cytology benign x2  -02/20/2021: Started sotorasib   -03/03/2021: GK to brain mets x2 (L parietal lobe and L hippocampus) 19 Gy to eac  -03/10/2021: Abatacept #5  -03/30/2021 CT c/a/p: Slight interval decrease in size of right upper lobe mass as well as decreased thickness of soft tissue nodule in the right upper lobe. Infiltrative soft tissue in the right paratracheal region has increased in density, which may reflect development of calcification. These findings likely reflect evolving posttreatment sequela. Unchanged ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe measuring 1.5 cm most suspicious for synchronous adenocarcinoma spectrum lesion. ***** in a/p.     INTERVAL HISTORY:  -04/07/2021: Abatacept #6    -Mr. ***** and his girlfriend ***** are here for follow up today.  -He continues to make slow but steady improvements.   -Now eating a whole food diet!  -Vision continue to be the slowest symptom to recover. He still has some double vision.   -Voice is normal at this point.   -Abatacept #7 planned on 05/04/2021 and then another one a month later   -He's gained back 23 lbs in the last 3 months now that his eating has improved.   -His back is sore. He has taken tylenol but he's trying to minimize that as well. He notices it more at 3 or 4 in the morning. He thinks it's because he's put on weight in a short period of time.   -Reports some nasal congestion that is improving, thinks it might be allergies.   -He is currently on prednisone 50 mg daily.   -Rheumatologist is planning to start alendronate for osteoporosis ppx.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** \"\nG12*****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed growth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He is tolerating treatment well so far without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy show a partial initial response. Primary tumor is ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. We've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Continue sotorasib 960 mg daily; tolerating well. Reserving chemo for next line of therapy.   Can space out labs to monthly in early May from an oncology standpoint   Restaging scans (CT c/a/p) around mid to late May 2021  MRI brain in 3 months per rad onc (around mid-May 2021; will aim to coordinate with CT scans if possible)  Precautions on sotorasib:       - No pepcid, zantac or other H2 blockers or PPIs -- he should stop lansoprazole before he starts sotorasib.        - Sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, may lower efficacy of prednisone (category C interaction); no empiric changes to prednisone taper but watch for worsening of symptoms after starting sotorasib         - Continue close LFT monitoring \"\nafter start, as will be higher risk given recent hepatitis. ***** out to q3 weeks now given normalization of LFTs, and by early May he can get them once a month from an oncologic standpoint.         - No DDI with IVIg or cellcept should that be required for his *****     #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. Not expected to be the cause of neurologic symptoms. He is s/p GK on 03/03/2021 to one parietal lesion and also lesion in L hippocampus.   - Sotorasib may have some CNS activity  - Include MRI on next set of routine restaging scans in mid-May. ***** need to coordinate around PPM.      #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x6 with at least 2 more doses planned.  Troponin downtrending, Trop-I normalized and Trop-T downtrending. ***** take time to rebuild cardiac muscle.  - Permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology for further monitoring and management with abatacept. Appreciate co-management.   - If he requires cellcept, not expected to have a drug-drug interaction with sotorasib   - Follow up EP for pacemaker assessment and interrogation  - ***** ask cardiology whether he can stop using CPAP machine, believe intention was for 4-6 weeks of use only to prevent apnea in s/o respiratory muscle weakness      #Immune-related myositis  Predominant symptom was bulbar weakness, although he also had more subtle widespread muscle weakness. Confirmed on EMG from 01/23/2021. His symptoms are finally turning a corner. His dysarthria is clearly improved and he reports less dysphagia as well, gaining back 23 lbs. Voice is stronger, swallowing is improved. Still with some double vision due to dysconjugate gaze, now has prism correction glasses, working with \"\nOT for continued bulbar and occular muscle strengthening. Discussed with rheumatology and neuromuscular colleagues and cardio-onc team. IVIg may theoretically interfere with abatacept action. For now, given improvement in his symptoms with time and steroids, we have been holding off on IVIg--but could always revisit in the future depending on trajectory. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams. Continue prolonged steroid taper. From my standpoint, starting to taper prednisone slowly sounds reasonable.   - From my standpoint, reasonable to start tapering prednisone per rheumatology  - Follow up with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - PT/OT, vision therapy      #Immune-related hepatitis  LFTs fortunately have resolved with steroids.  - CTM  - Follow up hepatology clinic in April 2021     #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Follow up with neuro angiography in 6 months to exclude recurrence (May 2021) -- he will need an enoxaparin bridge of 1 mg/kg BID with eliquis held for 72 hours before procedure and restarted 24 hours afterwards. I will coordinate this now and ask our staff to do some teaching if possible.     #Right IJ thrombus  Occlusive thrombus in right internal jugular vein, secondary to mass effects from right supraclavicular adenopathy, on eliquis.     #Low TSH  Referred to endocrine given multiple other ***** They feel like he had subclinical hyperthyroidism and now heading towards hypothyroidism consistent with thyroiditis. He may need thyroid replacement but they will continue monitoring with TFTs in 4-6 weeks.       #Supportive care  S/p 2 covid vaccines - Pfizer, end of June and mid-July; I confirmed with cardiology that we should still hold off on 3rd vaccine in light of recent myocarditis and ongoing elevated troponin T  Flu vaccine done \"\n04/01/2021     #Supportive care:  Appreciate speech involvement given dysphagia   Optho for prism correction glasses--done  Vision therapy for diplopia--ongoing   PT/OT  Referred to nutrition given weight loss; now improving  Prefers Quest for labs    Advance care planning  Unknown if patient has named a surrogate decision maker. Provider deferred discussion.    RTC 4 weeks to check in with Dr. *****     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.  \"\n"},

TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the brain were acquired at 3.0 tesla. CONTRAST MEDIA: Intravenous gadolinium chelate was administered for post-contrast imaging. FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect. There is an acute punctate infarct within the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere. Scattered punctate areas of FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular and deep white matter, suggestive of mild sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. The sellar and suprasellar regions are within normal limits. There is a trace right mastoid cell effusion. Localizer images including portions of the cervical spine demonstrate multilevel disc osteophyte complex and ligament flavum redundancy, causing at least moderate \"\nspinal canal stenosis, incompletely evaluated. There are abnormally enlarged right inferior frontal and gyrus rectus veins fed by right anterior ethmoidal arteries, compatible with a dural arteriovenous fistula. These varices connect to a more posteriorly blood-filled structure extending from the right carotid system to the region of the right basal ganglia, which fills with contrast, thought to represent an additional variceal pouch. This measures 22 x 7 x 11 mm (AP, transverse, CC dimensions). The major dural venous sinuses are patent.     1. Punctate acute infarct within the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere. 2. Evidence of high risk right ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistula with varices in the right gyrus rectus and basal ganglia. Neurosurgery consultation is recommended. No aneurysm.

The patient fully consented to undergo this procedure. PROCEDURE ***** *****:     The patient was brought to the Interventional Neurovascular operating room suite and placed supine on the angiography table. Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. General Anesthesia was provided by the UCSF Department of  Anesthesia throughout the procedure. Local anesthesia with September 30 cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine in the subcuticular and subcutaneous tissues of the right  inguinal region around the right  \"\ncommon femoral artery. An 11 blade was used to make a small skin incision at the groin puncture site. A 19 gauge single wall needle was used to puncture the right  common femoral artery. Upon brisk return of arterial blood, a 0.035 inch ***** guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right  common femoral artery. The needle was removed and a 9 French vascular sheath inserted over the guidewire into the right common femoral artery. The guidewire and dilator were removed and the sheath double flushed with heparinized saline solution. The sheath was sewn in place with 2-0 ***** and perfused with heparinized saline for the remainder of the procedure. This was attached to a blood pressure transducer for reference by the anesthesiologist during the procedure. Right common femoral artery angiography was performed by injecting 6 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 6 ***** centimeters of non-ionic contrast through the sheath giving approximately 20 digitally acquired angiographic images in the contralateral oblique projection. Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 5 F UCSF 2 diagnostic catheter was advanced through the abdominal and thoracic aorta over a ***** guidewire. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the right common carotid artery over the ***** guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the cranial ***** and lateral, projections using 1 separate injections of 7 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 9 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the left common carotid artery over the ***** guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double \"\nflushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the cranial ***** and lateral projections using 1 separate injections of 7 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 9 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the left internal carotid artery over the ***** guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  AP and lateral projections using 1 separate injections of 6 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 8 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the left external carotid artery over the ***** guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  AP and lateral projections using 1 separate injections of 2 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 5 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was selectively placed in the left occipital artery over the ***** guidewire. The guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution. With the catheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  ***** and ***** projections using 1 separate  hand injections of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic \"\nimages per projection. . 4500 of IV heparin were administered. Baseline ACT was 114 seconds. Following heparin administration repeat ACT was 205 seconds. This was not redosed during the procedure and not reversed at the completion of the procedure A Neuron ***** guide catheter was advanced over a 5 French Select inner guide catheter and Terumo guidewire into the left  external carotid artery. The inner catheter and guidewire was removed and the catheter double flushed with heparinized saline solution were and connected to continuous heparin saline flush. 5 mg of intra-arterial verapamil was administered to the external carotid artery. This the guide catheter remained positioned in the common carotid artery for the remainder of the procedure. ***** ***** microcatheter was prepared within a 044 DAC 115 cm intermediate catheter and advanced over a Synchro 10 ***** into the proximal left middle meningeal artery and connected to continuous heparinized saline flush. With the microcatheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  AP and lateral projections using 1 separate  hand injections of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. The intermediate catheter was advanced to the level of foramen spinosum. The microcatheter was advanced over the Synchro 10 ***** into a distal branch of the left middle meningeal artery anterior division and connected to continuous heparinized saline flush. With the microcatheter remaining in this position, biplane digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the  ***** and ***** projections using 1 separate  hand injections of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Under DSA roadmap, the microwire and microcatheter were carefully navigated to the middle meningeal-anterior falcine anastomosis then \"\nanteriorly along the anterior falcine artery to within 1 cm of the fistula site at the anterior margin of the anterior cranial fossa, just posterior to the frontal sinus. With the microcatheter in this distal position, and another single AP and lateral hand-injection angiogram was performed to delineate the anatomy of the fistula which included a rete-like channel and a prominent recipient venous pouch varix. The microcatheter was slowly flushed with DMSO. Using direct fluorscopic imaging and blank roadmapping technique, endovascular embolization was then performed by slowly injecting by ***** 18 into penetration to the recipient vein was seen and opacification of the meshlike fistulous at work was observed and the polymer began to reflux slightly. At this point, the ***** microcatheter was withdrawn under negative suction and the detachable tip was deployed in the distal anterior falcine artery with the remaining microcatheter withdrawn from the patient's body. Mid-embolization digital subtraction angiography was obtained in the AP and lateral projections from the guide catheter in the external carotid artery using multiple separate  hand injections of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection. Post embolization common carotid  artery digital subtraction angiography was then performed using 1 separate injections of 7 ***** centimeters per second for a total of 9 cc's of non-ionic contrast giving approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images per projection.  The catheters was removed from the patient's body. Hemostasis in the right groin was achieved after removal of the groin sheath by Angioseal No iatrogenic complications resulted from this procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Due to the technical difficulty of performing this complex procedure, additional physicians were required. SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  None.

INTERPRETATION OF FILMS: FINDINGS: Selective injection of the sheath accessing the right common femoral artery with the camera position over the pelvis demonstrates expected appearance of the external iliac, common femoral, and profunda femoris arteries without evidence of access related complication. Selective injection of the right common carotid artery with the camera positioned over the head demonstrates a normal carotid bifurcation as well as cervical internal and proximal branches of the external carotid arteries. There is no residual arteriovenous shunting as seen on previous angiogram. The ophthalmic artery opacifies beyond the 'bayonet' with clear visualization of the ciliary arteries and choroidal *****. Interval down regulation in size of previous posterior ethmoidal feeders arising from the distal internal maxillary which continue to drain to the abnormal anterior cranial fossa vein although this is contemporaneous with normal venous phase opacification. Branches of the internal carotid artery and a large posterior communicating artery otherwise opacify normally. Selective injection of the left common carotid artery \"\ndistress.

XR Chest 2 Views PA and Lateral    Result Date: 12/03/2020  EXAM: XR CHEST   TWO VIEWS REASON FOR STUDY: *****.11: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF UPPER LOBE, RIGHT BRONCHUS OR LUNG, : \"\nwith the camera positioned over the head demonstrates significant interval decrease in caliber of the middle meningeal artery, now nearly within normal limits/physiologic in size compared to the previous angiogram 5 days ago. There is very slow ***** of residual shunting via the anterior falcine connection which opacifies the anterior portion of the fistula. The ophthalmic artery has brisk antegrade flow up to the point of previously deployed coils which are distal to the ciliary arteries; normal choroidal ***** is clearly visualized. Selective injection of the left internal carotid artery shows no residual shunting from this territory with normal opacification of ***** branches. Selective injection of the left external carotid artery with the camera positioned over the head shows no residual shunting via posterior ethmoidal branches of the internal maxillary; as above, there is very slow and minimal shunting via the middle meningeal-anterior falcine branch. Superselective injection of the left middle meningeal artery delineates the branch which anastomoses to the anterior falcine artery and thereby supplies the residual fistula. A repeat injection with the microcatheter in distal position within the anterior falcine artery shows a complex at work of arteries supplying the shunt immediately posterior to the frontal sinus with sluggish opacification of a cortical vein along the cribriform plate. Intraprocedural fluoroscopic images show casting of ***** material throughout the fistula site extending posteriorly to the first cortical vein varix. Previously injected n-BCA is noted and a right ***** varix. Mid embolization nonselective injection of the left common carotid artery shows no residual arteriovenous shunting. The branches of the internal carotid artery opacify normally with no immediate angiographic complication.     1.  Compared with 12/19/2020, progressive decrease in residual shunt flow/volume to \"\nthe anterior cranial fossa dural arteriovenous fistula with residual supply from left middle meningeal artery via the anterior falcine artery. 2.  Technically successful ***** embolization of the residual falcine arterial feeder resulting in complete resolution of arteriovenous shunting. 3.  Note of presence of small quantity of n-BCA along the margins of a large posterior *****/perilenticular varix from the previous treatment. 4.  Given the indication for a longer duration anticoagulation in this patient and the high risk factors except this fistula, follow-up angiography is recommended in 6 months to exclude recurrence. Upon conclusion of the procedure, review images confirmed no evidence of unintentionally retained devices.

INTERPRETATION OF FILMS: FINDINGS: Selective injection of the sheath accessing the left common femoral artery with the camera position over the pelvis demonstrates expected appearance of the external iliac, common femoral, and profunda femoris arteries without evidence of access related complication. Selective injection of the right common carotid artery with the camera positioned over the neck demonstrates an expected appearance of the carotid bifurcation as well as cervical internal and proximal branches of the external carotid arteries. Selective injection of the right internal carotid artery with the camera positioned over the head demonstrates expected appearance of the petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the ***** as well as ipsilateral MCA and ***** branches.  There is no evidence of aneurysm. Abnormal arteriovenous shunting seen in the distal right ophthalmic artery from ethmoid branches. Venous varices seen along the anterior cranial fossa and extending into the right deep venous system to the straight sinus. Selective injection of the right external carotid artery with the camera positioned over the head demonstrates expected appearance of the branches. Abnormal arteriovenous shunting seen within ethmoid branches from the internal maxillary artery. Selective injection left vertebral artery with the camera positioned over the posterior fossa demonstrates expected appearance of the \"\nvertebral -basilar system without evidence of aneurysm, arterial-venous fistula, or other pathological vascular anomaly. Selective injection of the left common carotid artery with the camera positioned over the neck demonstrates a normal carotid bifurcation as well as cervical internal and proximal branches of the external carotid arteries. Selective injection of the left internal carotid artery with the camera positioned over the head demonstrates expected appearance of the petrous, cavernous, and supraclinoid segments of the ***** as well as ipsilateral MCA and ***** branches.

Now with evidence of progression in 2 punctate foci of enhancement in the bilateral parietal lobes and also enlargement of the  RUL primary tumor, on sotorasib.       We discussed the indications for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases. In patients with well controlled extracranial disease and high function, SRS is emerging as standard of care, with equivalent survival when compared with patients treated with both SRS and whole brain radiation therapy (***** et al. ***** 2006; ***** et al. J Clin Oncol 2011; ***** et al. ***** 2016). Survival benefit is also appreciated in patients with multiple brain metastases treated with SRS (***** et al. Lancet Oncol 2014).    In addition to the brain lesions which are already present, we also discussed the possibility of stereotactic radiosurgery for any additional metastases that are identified at the time of treatment, the likelihood of which correlates with the number of brain metastases that were initially present at consultation, and inversely with the size of the largest lesion (***** et al. J Neurosurg 2016). Other options for treatment were also discussed, including supportive care. However, given ***** ***** *****  favorable performance status \"\nand the significant risk of progressive neurologic symptoms without local intervention, we recommended against supportive care, which may be a suitable option for patients with poor performance status (***** et al. 2016 Lancet).      The risks of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery were discussed, including short term sequelae such as fatigue and a small risk of alopecia approximately 3 weeks after treatment which would likely regrow within 3 months. Long-term risks associated with radiosurgery were also discussed, including treatment-associated brain edema and/or radionecrosis potentially causing headaches or other neurological symptoms requiring corticosteroids, anti-angiogenic agents, or even surgical intervention to control. In that regard, the risks of radionecrosis after Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases vary with multiple factors, including prior stereotactic radiosurgery, volumetric parameters, and in some cases, systemic therapy, tumor histology and connective tissue disease (***** et al. 2015 J Neurosurg).

TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the brain were acquired at 3.0 tesla. CONTRAST MEDIA: Intravenous gadolinium chelate was administered for post-contrast imaging. FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect. There is an acute punctate infarct within the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere. \"\nScattered punctate areas of FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular and deep white matter, suggestive of mild sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. The sellar and suprasellar regions are within normal limits. There is a trace right mastoid cell effusion. Localizer images including portions of the cervical spine demonstrate multilevel disc osteophyte complex and ligament flavum redundancy, causing at least moderate spinal canal stenosis, incompletely evaluated. There are abnormally enlarged right inferior frontal and gyrus rectus veins fed by right anterior ethmoidal arteries, compatible with a dural arteriovenous fistula. These varices connect to a more posteriorly blood-filled structure extending from the right carotid system to the region of the right basal ganglia, which fills with contrast, thought to represent an additional variceal pouch. This measures 22 x 7 x 11 mm (AP, transverse, CC dimensions). The major dural venous sinuses are patent.     1. Punctate acute infarct within the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere. 2. Evidence of high risk right ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistula with varices in the right gyrus rectus and basal ganglia. Neurosurgery consultation is recommended. No aneurysm.

TECHNIQUE: The following MR sequences were performed through the brain: sagittal T1, axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial T1, axial and coronal diffusion weighted imaging, and coronal MPGR. Post-gadolinium axial and coronal T1 were performed following intravenous injection of 6.7 ml gadolinium-based contrast. Medication reconciliation form reviewed and any changes \"\nrelated to this procedure resolved. FINDINGS: Parenchyma: No acute hemorrhage, acute infarction, mass or abnormal enhancement. Mild scattered white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities, non-specific, but most commonly attributable to chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No enhancing lesions to suggest malignancy. Ventricles and extra-axial spaces: Appropriate for age. Orbits: Normal. Visualized paranasal sinuses: Clear. Mastoid air cells: Clear. Bones: Normal. Additional comment: Incidental note is made of a 2.5 x 1.0 cm aneurysm off the posterior communicating artery at its can occasion with the internal carotid artery.  Additional conglomerate aneurysms are noted in the right anterior inferior frontal lobe measuring 1.9 x 1.6 cm, 1.3 x 1.2, and 0.7 x 0.4 cm. These additional aneurysms appear to arise from a feeder vessel from the dominant 2.5 cm aneurysm.     1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. No enhancing lesions to suggest malignancy. 3. 2.5 cm aneurysm off the right posterior communicating artery.  A feeder vessel off the 2.5 cm aneurysm gives rise to additional aneurysms residing within the anterior inferior right frontal lobe.

Images were obtained from the lung apices to the lung bases.  Multiplanar 3-dimensional maximum intensity projection reconstructions were  performed. Medication reconciliation form reviewed and any changes related to  this procedure resolved. Standard technical protocol was utilized.  Dosimetry: CTDIvol:  7.8 MGy; DLP:  362.73 MGy-cm     (Note: These dose  indicators do not reflect the effective patient dose, but are metrics based on  standardized CT phantoms. The effective dose may vary widely depending on body  size, shape, and other patient factors). Dose reduction was performed with  automated exposure control, iterative reconstruction technique and/or  adjustment of the mA and/or kV for patient size.    FINDINGS:  Pulmonary Arteries: Filling defect noted in a left lower lobe sub segmental  pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonary emboli.  Poor opacification of  right middle and right lower lobe pulmonary arteries may be flow related  although pulmonary embolism not excluded.  Aorta: Normal caliber but otherwise not well evaluated for abnormality such as  dissection due to bolus technique.  Lungs: Increase in size of previous 3.8 by 4.0 cm and now 5.2 x 4.0 cm right  upper lobe mass.  Patchy pulmonary reticulations again noted.  Mediastinum: Increase in size of previous 3.0 x 4.8 and now 5.5 x 7.0 cm right  paratracheal mass.  The mass is now seen to invade and markedly narrow the  trachea.  There is soft tissue density extending into the right mainstem  bronchus which could represent any combination of tumor/secretions which on CT  appears totally occluded however there is distal aeration of the bronchial  tree indicating that there is still some communication.  Mass \"\nor secretions  also extend into the bronchus intermedius and right middle lobe bronchi.  New  2 cm right infrahilar mass.  The mass compresses the left brachial cephalic  vein.  There is likely compression of the right brachial cephalic vein which  however is not opacified due to left arm injection.  Pleura: Small right pleural effusion.  Chest Wall: Unremarkable.  Axillae and supraclavicular: No significant change in large right  supraclavicular mass  Upper Abdomen: Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Musculoskeletal: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions on routine  bone windows.  No change in appearance of the spine with thoracolumbar  vertebral plasty changes noted.    IMPRESSION:  1. There is a left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism.  Right middle  and lower lobe pulmonary arteries are not well opacified which may be flow  related however superimposed pulmonary embolism not excluded.  2. Increase in size of right upper lobe mass.  3. Increase in size of mediastinal mass.  4. Mediastinal mass is now seen to invade and narrow the trachea.  5.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, here for follow up.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Unfortunately restaging scans  during recent hospitalization suggest he's had some interval progression, with growth in ***** primary tumor on CT from 01/23/2021 and two new parietal metastases on brain MRI from 01/23/2021. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy has gotten smaller, however.   - UCSF path review suggests poorly-differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma histology, \"\nwhich is a particularly aggressive NSCLC histologic subtype   - Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors  - Review scans and pathology at upcoming thoracic tumor board to confirm progression and whether to start next line of cancer-directed therapy now in light of his other active medical problems  - Most likely, given ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, I will recommend starting sotorasib as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. I have ordered this but have instructed him to hold off on picking it up until we finalize ***** at tumor board.  - When he starts sotorasib, ***** ***** *****, and there are several precautions to take:   - No pepcid, zantac or other H2 blockers or PPIs -- he should stop lansoprazole before he starts sotorasib.    - Sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, may lower efficacy of prednisone (category C interaction); no empiric changes to prednisone taper but watch for worsening of symptoms after starting sotorasib    - If he is unable to swallow pills due to dysphagia: there is an option for dispersing tablets in water; sotorasib pills should not be crushed. Instructions discussed with patient: put 8 tablets in 120 mL room temperature, non-carbonated water. Slowly swirl mixture, do not shake, to disperse tablets into small pieces. Mixture should be pale yellow to light yellow in color, drink entire mixture immediately after dispersion   - Out of pocket cost is around $2500, patient given info about patient assistance program to help finance, and will wait to start until confirm TB recommendations and extent of growth on scans    - He will need close LFT monitoring after start, weekly initially and will be higher risk given recent hepatitis     - No DDI with IVIg or cellcept should that be required for his *****   - Can reserve more chemotherapy for next line of \"\ntherapy    #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. Not expected to be the cause of neurologic symptoms.   - Rad onc will schedule him for GK in the next few weeks.   - Sotorasib may have some CNS activity, but would still treat definitively with RT     #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x4.  Troponin downtrending but not yet normalized.   - Permanently discontinue checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology later today for further monitoring and management   - If he requires cellcept, not expected to have a drug-***** interaction with sotorasib   - Follow up EP for pacemaker assessment and interrogation    #Immune-related myositis  Now believed to be the cause of his bulbar weakness based on EMG results from 01/23/2021. CK is downtrending but may improvement in symptoms may lag. He is still very symptomatic with ongoing *****, dysarthria, dysphagia that are severely impacting QoL. Discussed with rheumatology and neuromuscular colleagues, I believe he may require additional therapy (e.g. IVIg) given lack of adequate improvement in his symptoms despite now two months of steroids and two course of high dose IV steroids. Appreciate involvement of rheum and neuromuscular teams.  - Follow up on February 11 with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - We will follow up on status of home OT/speech referrals, patient has not yet been scheduled     #Bulbar weakness   Ongoing diplopia with leftward gaze, dysphagia, dysarthria c/w severe bulbar muscle weakness. There was initially concern for multiple cranial nerve palsies (CN VI and IV) as the etiology of his symptoms  Versus possible ***** disease versus autoimmune process. Work up for myasthenic syndrome has \"\nbeen negative, appears anatomically remote from ethmoid dural AV fistula that was embolized, LP cytology negative x2. Now suspected due to more generalized myositis based on EMG results and the work up that was sent during his recent hospitalization. Impacting QoL.   - Rheum and neuromuscular clinic follow up next week   - Follow up results of pending tests form recent hospitalization  - I will review his scans at thoracic tumor board next week, also ask about the calcified mediastinal mass, query thymoma    - Agree with IVIg if recommended, continue prednisone taper      #Immune-related hepatitis  LFTs fortunately have improved with steroids.  - CTM  - Could add cellcept if needed per hepatology consult in the hospital if fails to respond to steroids  - Follow up hepatology clinic in April 2021  - LFTs do not preclude sotorasib initiation but will need to monitor weekly after starting as he will be at higher risk of liver toxicity with treatment      #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Follow up with neuro angiography in 6 months to exclude recurrence (May 2021)      #Supportive care  S/p 2 covid vaccines - Pfizer, end of June and mid-July; wondering about timing of 3rd booster vaccine. He is eligible, but I will discuss with his care team about the timing in light of recent myocarditis. For now holding off.      #Supportive care:  Needs home OT, speech -- need to follow up on status, referred after discharge but not yet set up  Continue dysphagia diet for now   Optho for prisms  Vision therapy for diplopia? ***** valley optometry  Referred to nutrition given weight loss   Prefers Quest for labs    Advance care planning  Unknown if patient has named a surrogate decision maker. Provider deferred discussion.    RTC 2 weeks to check in (NP or Dr. *****)    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues \"\nwere addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 60 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.    \"\n"},

His voice is clearly better today. His swallowing is also much improved. He has gained back 12 lbs. Appetite is good, he's \"eating like a *****.\"  He still is having blurry vision. His left eye is not tracking in a coordinated fashion with the right eye. He is following with optometry, they are getting him prism correction glasses and are planning OT with eye exercises to help strength his occular muscles.   We discussed that his myositis recovery is going to take time to rebuild muscles etc.   Dr. ***** decreased his prednisone dose to 50 mg about a week ago, plan is for 2 weeks and then continue taper.  He is tolerating sotorasib well without side effects  He is winded more easily than he used to, needs to stop to catch his breath. No wheezing or real cough, occasionally needs to clear his throat.   No fevers or chills.     Objective:     There were no vitals taken for this visit. Video visit    /10    ECOG Performance Status: 1 - Symptomatic but completely ambulatory  Constitutional: Well-appearing, no acute distress. Appropriately interactive.  Eyes: No scleral icterus. Conjunctiva clear.   ENMT: Moist mucus membranes. No oral lesions visible. Disconjugate gaze, at times need to close left eye to avoid seeing double.   Lymph: Deferred  Respiratory: Respirations unlabored. Speaking in full sentences, voice is clearly stronger today.  Cardiovascular: Deferred  GI: Deferred  MSK: No peripheral edema.

Complicated course with multiple severe \"\n***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Unfortunately restaging scans during recent hospitalization suggest he's had some interval progression, with growth in ***** primary tumor on CT from 01/23/2021 and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI from 01/23/2021. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy has gotten smaller, however. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Given the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He is tolerating treatment well so far. We will plan for restaging scans in mid-March to make sure we're on the right track with his treatment. We've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Continue sotorasib 960 mg daily; tolerating well. Reserving chemo for next line of therapy.   Restaging scans (CT c/a/p) in 3 weeks or so to check in on initial response.  MRI brain in 3 months per rad onc (around mid-May 2020)   Precautions on sotorasib:       - No pepcid, zantac or other H2 blockers or PPIs -- he should stop lansoprazole before he starts sotorasib.        - Sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, may lower efficacy of prednisone (category C interaction); no empiric changes to prednisone taper but watch for worsening of symptoms after starting sotorasib        - If he is unable to swallow pills due to dysphagia: there is an option for dispersing tablets in water; sotorasib pills should not be crushed. Instructions discussed with patient: put 8 tablets in 120 mL room temperature, non-carbonated water. Slowly swirl mixture, do not shake, to disperse \"\ntablets into small pieces. Mixture should be pale yellow to light yellow in color, drink entire mixture immediately after dispersion        - He will need close LFT monitoring after start, as will be higher risk given recent hepatitis. ***** out to q2 weeks given normalization of LFTs.         - No DDI with IVIg or cellcept should that be required for his *****     #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases.

CK is downtrending but improvement in symptoms may lag improvement in labs. His symptoms are finally turning a corner. His dysarthria is clearly improved and he reports less dysphagia as well, gaining 12 lbs which is hopefully a good sign. Still with some double vision due to dysconjugate \"\ngaze, but has plan for prism correction glasses, working with OT for continued bulbar and occular muscle strengthening. Discussed with rheumatology and neuromuscular colleagues and cardio-onc team. IVIg may theoretically interfere with abatacept action. For now, given improvement in his symptoms with time and steroids, we have been holding off on IVIg--but could always revisit in the future depending on trajectory. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams.  - Follow up with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - Continue prednisone taper per rheum  - PT/OT, vision therapy      #Immune-related hepatitis  LFTs fortunately have resolved with steroids.  - CTM  - Could add cellcept if needed per hepatology consult in the hospital if fails to respond to steroids  - Follow up hepatology clinic in April 2021  - LFTs do not preclude sotorasib initiation but will need to monitor closely as he is at higher risk of liver toxicity with treatment; fortunately labs look good so will space out to q2 weeks for now     #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Follow up with neuro angiography in 6 months to exclude recurrence (May 2021)     #Low TSH  Referred to endocrine given multiple other *****.      #Supportive care  S/p 2 covid vaccines - Pfizer, end of June and mid-July; wondering about timing of 3rd booster vaccine.

PD-L1 TPS < 1%.  - 11/17/2020: C1D1 carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab  - 11/20/2020 CT neck: Worsening supraclavicular and upper mediastinal lymphadenopathy with enlarging necrotic lymph nodes. Occlusive thrombus in right internal jugular vein, secondary to mass effects from right supraclavicular adenopathy.    - 11/20/2020 CT chest: Interval increase in size of masses within the RUL. Unchanged additional GGOs and solid nodule in *****. Worsening mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. Diffuse right chest wall subcutaneous edema.   - 11/23/2020 MRI brain: incidental 2.5 x 1 cm aneurysm of posterior communicating artery, no intracranial metastases.   Developed rapidly enlarging right supraclavicular LN conglomerate, as well as enlarged upper mediastinal lymph nodes, with resulting narrowing of the airways and an occlusive thrombus in the RIJ secondary to mass effect, for which radiation was initiated.   - 11/22/2020-11/22/2020: initial RT, 600 cGy in 2 fr to R supraclavicular *****  - 11/26/2020-11/28/2020: IMRT to supraclavicular node, mediastinal disease, and primary tumor, 800 cGy in 4 fr  - 12/02/2020-12/12/2020: IMRT accelerated given planned NSG procedure, 2500 cGy given in 10 fr   - 12/13/2021-01/01/2021: Admitted for planned elective management of ethmoid dural AVM, but found to have elevated LFTs and trop/CK elevations on admission, complete heart block, ultimately diagnosed with ***** myocarditis (biopsy-diagnosed) and hepatitis, s/p 5 days of pulse dose steroids and 3 injections of abatacept, as well as ***** ***** pacemaker placement for CHB.    -12/16/2020 CT chest: Compared with 11/20/2020, decreased size of RUL mass and right upper mediastinal/supraclavicular LAD \"\nDecreased mass effect on right brachiocephalic and right subclavian veins compared to prior. Chronic thrombosis of right IJ.

High risk right ethmoid dural AV fistula.   -12/30/2020 CT angiogram brain/neck: Asymmetric filling of the left cavernous sinus on CTA phase may reflect residual arteriovenous shunting. Relative narrowing of the right A1 segment compared to MRI of brain performed on 11/26/2020, which may reflect differences in technique versus vasospasm. Redemonstrated RUL mass grossly unchanged compared to 12/16/2020.  -01/20/2021 Cardiology follow up: troponin *****, recommend dose #4 abatacept while weaning steroids.  -01/20/2021 UCSF pathology review of OSH biopsies:    Right supraclavicular LN: metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, most likely NSCLC, possibly adenosquamous carcinoma.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed \"\ngrowth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He tolerated treatment well without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy showed a partial initial response. Primary tumor was ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. However, he developed severe lower back pain in late April, and restaging CT c/a/p in 05/27/2021 confirmed significant worsening metastatic disease, with an increase in size of RUL primary tumor, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a new 4.6 cm L2 vertebral body osseous metastasis. He has now undergone palliative RT to the spine, kyphoplasty for severe ongoing back pain, and is now s/p 2 cycles of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel chemo, all locally up in *****. I've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Continue with carboplatin/paclitaxel as systemic therapy; weekly at first to ensure tolerability. Tolerating weekly dosing with minimal side effects. Has large paratracheal node I suspect is contributing to ***** and swallowing difficulty with pressure on trachea that has not improved but also not gotten worse. His supraclavicular node is waxing and waning in size. He will come in next week to evaluate. Could stay at weekly or increase to *****. At this time will stay weekly. His back pain is significantly better after radiation and kyphoplasty. He will be restaged on 08/24/21 at ***** .  MRI brain with routine scans, at least every 3 months; next around August 2020    #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI \"\nbrain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. He is s/p GK on 03/03/2021 to one parietal lesion and also lesion in L hippocampus. Brain MRI on 06/10/2021 shows no new or enlarging intracranial mets.   - MRI brain every 3 months or so; need to be coordinated around PPM. Next due around August 2020     #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x7. Given progressive lung cancer, no more abatacept doses are currently planned. Continue ***** 30 mg without further tapering until Troponin T normalizes. At this point, Trop-I normalized and Trop-T downtrending. ***** take time to rebuild cardiac muscle.  - Permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology for further monitoring and management.  - Further doses of abatacept on hold for now in light of cancer progression   -Continue prednisone 30 mg/day  -Continue trending Troponin T    #Bone metastases  Agree with starting zolendronic acid rather than alendronate for tolerability. This will be done locally in ***** after dental clearance.   Pt to confirm with dentist okay for bisphosphonates.   Local Oncologist to give monthly.     #Severe back pain  Unfortunately, the L2 metastasis is causing severe pain that has been difficult to manage and escalating quickly. Appreciate involvement of his local team for management.  -Continue regimen of APAP, methadone, oxycodone, and gabapentin per his local team  -Finally some improvement in severe symptoms after kyphoplasty, radiation     #Edema  Low threshold to get bilateral extremity ultrasound to r/o DVT. However, since also present in upper extremities, thrombosis seems less likely. September just reflect all the extra fluid he received with the procedure last week and chemo, in setting of low albumin. Other possibilities to consider if worsens are \"\nheart failure, or adenopathy impairing venous drainage.    - Consider further w/u if persists (DVT ultrasound, *****, ***** c/a/p)     #Immune-related myositis  Predominant symptom was bulbar weakness, although he also had more subtle widespread muscle weakness. Confirmed on EMG from 01/23/2021. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams. Continue prolonged steroid taper. He is down to prednisone 30 mg/day, will hold of on tapering further until troponin T normalizes.   - Follow up with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - Continue prednisone 30 mg/day for now until Troponin T normalizes  - PT/OT, vision therapy      #Immune-related hepatitis  LFTs fortunately have resolved with steroids.  - CTM     #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Neuro angiography in 6 months without evidence of recurrence in May 2021    #Low appetite  Continue ensure./boost nutritional supplements.

COMMENT:    Thank you for the opportunity to review this case. We completely agree  with the original pathologists' diagnoses of metastatic poorly  differentiated carcinoma in both biopsies (*****-*****) and  (*****-*****) and also favor non-small cell lung carcinoma. H&E  sections from both biopsies reveal similar findings of a malignant  poorly differentiated neoplasm. The tumor cells are present as  discohesive epithelioid and occasional spindle cells within desmoplastic  stroma, as nests with occasional gland-like arrangements, and focally as  flat sheets with squamoid appearance. Tumor nuclei are enlarged,  hyperchromatic, markedly pleomorphic, and have frequent large nucleoli.  There is abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with distinct cell borders, and  rare cells with intracytoplasmic keratin-like material are noted (most  prominent in the squamoid sheets in the left axillary lymph node).  Frequent mitoses are present.     The provided immunohistochemical stains performed on the right  supraclavicular lymph node (*****-*****, block 1A) \"\nwere reviewed and  show the following staining pattern in the tumor cells:  TTF-1: Negative.  Napsin A: Negative.  PD-L1: No expression; tumor proportion score (TPS): <1%.    By report, additional stains performed on the same material  (*****-*****, block 1A, not available for review) showed the following  results in the tumor cells:   *****: Negative.  CK7: Positive.  P63: Positive.    The provided immunohistochemical stains performed on the left axillary  lymph node (*****-*****, block 1A) were reviewed and show the following  staining pattern in the tumor cells:   P16: Negative.  *****/6: Positive.  CK7: Positive.  GATA3: Negative.  TTF-1: Negative.  Napsin A: Negative.  Mucicarmine: Negative.    By report, the right supraclavicular lymph node sample (*****-*****) was  sent to ***** ***** ***** (*****-*****) for molecular testing, which  revealed a ***** pathogenic variant in ***** 2 (p.*****), high tumor  mutation burden (11 mutations/MB), and a ***** pathogenic variant in *****  6 (p.*****).     By report, the right supraclavicular lymph node sample (21-*****-*****)  was sent for flow cytometry revealing no monoclonal B-cell or  immunophenotypically abnormal T-cell population with a mildly increased  CD4:CD8 ratio; and the left axillary lymph node tissue (21-*****-*****)  was sent for flow cytometry, but the sample was non-diagnostic.     Additional immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated at  UCSF on the left axillary lymph node (*****-*****, block 1A) which show  the following staining pattern in the tumor cells:   P63: Positive.  *****: Negative.  *****: Negative.    Taken together, the histologic, immunohistochemical and molecular  findings are those of a metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell  carcinoma, most consistent with lung origin. The lack of GATA3 and CK20  expression argues against metastatic urothelial carcinoma, and the lack  of ***** and SOX10 expression and expression of CK7 argue \"\nagainst  metastatic melanoma. The presence of both gland-like arrangements and  sheet-like squamoid nests with strong ***** expression and occasional  dyskeratotic cells raises the possibility of adenosquamous carcinoma.             Clinical History  ***** ***** is a *****-year-old man with a remote history low-grade  papillary urothelial carcinoma (2004) and melanoma of the upper back  (2017) who presented in August 2020 with a cough. Imaging revealed a 2.9  cm right upper lobe mass with extensive mediastinal and right  supraclavicular adenopathy. He underwent biopsy of a right  supraclavicular lymph node and left axillary lymph node at an outside  hospital. Dr. ***** ***** requests a UCSF pathologist to review the  case.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle \"\ncarboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed growth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He tolerated treatment well without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy showed a partial initial response. Primary tumor was ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. However, he developed severe lower back pain in late April, and restaging CT c/a/p in 05/27/2021 confirmed significant worsening metastatic disease, with an increase in size of RUL primary tumor, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a new 4.6 cm L2 vertebral body osseous metastasis. He has now undergone palliative RT to the spine, kyphoplasty for severe ongoing back pain, and is now s/p 2 cycles of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel chemo, all locally up in *****. I've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Continue with carboplatin/paclitaxel as systemic therapy; weekly at first to ensure tolerability. I have been in touch with his local oncologist. Dr *****. If he does well, consider increasing to q3 week dosing.   S/p palliative RT to L2 metastases and kyphoplasty.   Restaging scans after 6 to 8 weeks of therapy to assess initial response; these can be done \"\nlocally per his preference   MRI brain with routine scans, at least every 3 months; next around August 2020    #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases.

Increased soft tissue thickening adjacent to mass along the right upper hilum, with new obstruction of a traversing segmental right upper lobe  bronchus. Findings could also reflect evolving post radiation effects; however, close follow-up imaging is recommended. Increased moderate right pleural effusion. Increased size of supraclavicular and mediastinal masses. Decreased intensity of peripheral ***** of enhancement noted, although this may simply  reflect differences in contrast bolus timing. Likely occluded right internal jugular vein. Redemonstrated L2 pathologic fracture, status post cement augmentation, with interval increased height loss at L2 and now L1 compared to 06/26/2021. Thickened segment of nondilated bowel in the central abdomen, nonspecific,  and possibly reflecting *****, though treatment effects are also possible if there is history of radiation to \"\nthis vicinity.   UCSF overread: Compared to 05/27/2021, significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as new or enlarging right paraspinal intramuscular masses. Findings are concerning for worsening metastatic disease. No significant change in right upper lobe mass however with increased architectural distortion, volume loss, and reticulation in the upper lobes anteriorly and *****. Findings are favored to represent postradiation change, recommend correlation with patient treatment history. Compared to 05/27/2021 interval pathologic compression fracture of the L2 vertebral body, with additional compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body as described above. Sclerosis within the L1 vertebral body may reflect sequela of mechanical adjacent segment fracture or an additional underlying osseous metastasis. Patient is status post vertebroplasty at these levels, with significant focal kyphosis and osseous narrowing of the spinal canal. The extraosseous component of tumor at L2 is significantly reduced in size from the prior exam, no longer conspicuous. No findings suspicious for new metastasis within the abdomen or pelvis.    -Mr. ***** and his girlfriend ***** are here for follow up today.  -He is having a little more pain in his back; taking 10 mg oxycodone; still taking gabapentin, methadone (20 mg qAm, 20 mg q afternoon, 30 mg at bedtime)  -He's been having some nosebleeds as well that are new  -Breathing is okay  -Voice is still hoarse  -Coughing up a small amount of blood, small streaks mixed in with his phlegm; new in the last few weeks  -Chemotherapy is tolerable; he is feeling weak  -He's had a hard time putting on weight, down to 117 lbs  -Still on prednisone 30 mg daily     Objective:     There were no vitals taken for this visit.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology), here for follow up.     #Poorly \"\ndifferentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed growth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He tolerated treatment well without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy showed a partial initial response. Primary tumor was ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. However, he developed severe lower back pain in late April, and restaging CT c/a/p in 05/27/2021 confirmed significant worsening metastatic disease, with an increase in size of RUL primary tumor, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a new 4.6 cm L2 vertebral body osseous metastasis. He has now undergone palliative RT to the spine, kyphoplasty for severe ongoing back pain, and is now s/p 6 cycles of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel chemo, all locally up in *****. I've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Unfortunately, restaging CT c/a/p from 08/24/2021 show progression, in particular in the \"\nright supraclavicular lymph node, mediastinal lymph nodes, and a paraspinal intramuscular metastasis. I think there's been enough progression to merit a change in therapy, in particular because symptom-wise he is feeling worse too. We discussed several standard of care treatment options. He had only one cycle of pemetrexed-based therapy at the time of diagnosis, so could revisit pemetrexed now. Advantages are tolerability and also it has some CNS penetration. However, only appropriate for adenocarcinoma histology. Gemcitabine is another very reasonable option, and I might favor this for now given it has activity in both adenocarcinoma and squamous histologies, and we have never fully pinned down his NSCLC histology. Discussed with Dr. ***** and she will plan to start him on gemcitabine now.  Restaging scans after 6 to 8 weeks of therapy to assess initial response; these can be done locally per his preference MRI brain with routine scans, at least every 3 months; due now. Unfortunately we do not have any good trial options within our thoracic group; he would not qualify for immunotherapy-based combinations given life-threatening ***** history. However, I will him to phase I now to determine whether there are any tumor agnostic trial options that are non-immunotherapy based.    I also recommend another biopsy of an area of progression. Discussed with radiology, and the most accessible area is likely the right supraclavicular lymph node, which has nearly doubled in size and is superficial. Discussed getting this at *****, but after visit today it sounds like Dr. ***** can arrange in ***** with their interventional radiology group, so will cancel the order for UCSF.

Then on sotorasib but developed progression, very painful L2 vertebral body metastasis for which he is s/p palliative RT and kyphoplasty, followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel. Then progressed and now on gemcitabine.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  - August 2020: CXR performed to work up cough revealed a RUL consolidation  - 09/30/2020 CT chest: 2.9 cm RUL mass with extensive mediastinal and right supraclavicular adenopathy.  - 10/07/2020 PET/CT: FDG uptake in 2.8 RUL mass, uptake in hilar, bilateral mediastinal nodes and right supraclavicular adenopathy, uptake in left axillary lymph nodes. Low level uptake in healing left lateral 10th rib fracture, and low level uptake and subtle sclerosis of L4 vertebral body.   - 10/14/2020: Biopsy of right supraclavicular LN                Path: poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma               IHC: TTF-1 and napsin negative, CK7+, *****+, PD-L1 0% (TPS <1%)               ***** NGS: ***** *****, TMB-high (11 *****/mb), ***** p.194R, MS-S               Negative for actionable mutations in *****, *****, EGFR, *****, *****, NTRK May 24/3. VUS in *****.  10/21/2020 bilateral axillary ultrasound: prominent LN in both axillae, lymph nodes without ultrasound pathologic features  - 10/30/2020: Biopsy of left axilla LN               Path: \"\nany good trial options within our thoracic group; he would not qualify for immunotherapy-based combinations given life-threatening ***** history. However, I referred him to phase I to determine whether there are any tumor agnostic trial options that are non-immunotherapy based. Mr. ***** is now scheduled to see them in early October. Other standard of care options down the line could be revisiting pemetrexed chemotherapy. We discussed today that otherwise he has few good standard options for treatment, unfortunately. He is being co-managed by palliative care for symptoms locally.     - Discussed plan with Dr. *****  - Continue gemcitabine locally in *****  - Other SoC options down the line: pemetrexed   - follow up ***** NGS testing from right supraclavicular lymph node   - Phase I referral placed previously, he is scheduled now on 10/27/2021  - Immunotherapy contraindicated given history of life-threatening ***** (myocarditis, myositis)   - CT c/a/p scan locally in 6 to 8 weeks after starting therapy (plus MRI brain at *****)   - Agree with MRI spine and palliative RT to paraspinal mass, thoracic spine mets, and possibly R hilum for palliation     #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. He is s/p GK on 03/03/2021 to one parietal lesion and also lesion in L hippocampus. Brain MRI on 06/10/2021 shows no new or enlarging intracranial mets.   - MRI brain every 3 months or so; need to be coordinated around PPM. Due now; he will follow up about scheduling with radiology.      #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x7. Given progressive lung cancer, no more abatacept doses are currently planned. Continue prednisone 30 mg without further tapering until Troponin T normalizes. At this point, \"\nTrop-I normalized and Trop-T downtrending. ***** take time to rebuild cardiac muscle.  - Permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology for further monitoring and management.  - Further doses of abatacept on hold for now in light of cancer progression   -Continue prednisone 30 mg/day; taper as tolerated OK per rheum team in light of overall cancer prognosis   -He is no longer using the CPAP at night  -Continue trending Troponin T  -Cardiac MRI is pending; in light of overall goals of care/prognosis, I will revisit with Dr. ***** the urgency     #Bone metastases  Agree with starting zolendronic acid rather than alendronate for tolerability. This will be done locally in ***** after dental clearance.     #Severe back pain  L2 metastasis caused severe pain that was difficult to manage and escalating quickly.   -Continue regimen of APAP, methadone, oxycodone per his local team  -Finally some improvement in severe symptoms after kyphoplasty, radiation   -Tapered off gabapentin  -MRI spine planned in ***** soon to guide role of future RT    #Immune-related myositis  Predominant symptom was bulbar weakness, although he also had more subtle widespread muscle weakness. Confirmed on EMG from 01/23/2021. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams. Continue prolonged steroid taper. He is down to prednisone 30 mg/day, will hold of on tapering further until troponin T normalizes.   - Follow up with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - Continue prednisone 30 mg/day for now until Troponin T normalizes  - PT/OT, vision therapy   - Check with Dr. ***** about booster      #Immune-related hepatitis  Resolved with steroids.  - CTM     #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Neuro angiography without evidence of recurrence in May 2021    #Low appetite  Continue \"\nensure/boost nutritional supplements. Also discussed mirtazepine as a possible approach to help with both insomnia and low appetite; rx'ed but did not tolerate one dose (foggy headed, dry mouth)    #Right IJ thrombus  Occlusive thrombus in right internal jugular vein, secondary to mass effects from right supraclavicular adenopathy, on eliquis.     #Low TSH  Referred to endocrine given multiple other ***** They feel like he had subclinical hyperthyroidism and now heading towards hypothyroidism consistent with thyroiditis. He may need thyroid replacement but they will continue monitoring with TFTs in 4-6 weeks.       #Supportive care  S/p 2 covid vaccines - Pfizer, end of June and mid-July; I confirmed with cardiology that we should still hold off on 3rd vaccine in light of recent myocarditis and ongoing elevated troponin T  Flu vaccine done 04/01/2021     #Supportive care:  Appreciate speech involvement given dysphagia.  Optho for prism correction glasses--done  Vision therapy for diplopia--ongoing   PT/OT  Referred to nutrition given weight loss in the past  Prefers Quest for labs    RTC 2 weeks follow up with ***** for symptom check (in person), and in 4 weeks for Dr. ***** (in person)     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my \"\nlocation and the patient's location.

Occlusive thrombus in right internal jugular vein, secondary to mass effects from right supraclavicular adenopathy.    - 11/20/2020 CT chest: Interval increase in size of masses within the RUL. Unchanged additional GGOs and solid nodule in *****. Worsening mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. Diffuse right chest wall subcutaneous edema.   - 11/23/2020 MRI brain: incidental 2.5 x 1 cm aneurysm of posterior communicating artery, no intracranial metastases. Developed rapidly enlarging right supraclavicular LN conglomerate, as well as enlarged upper mediastinal lymph nodes, with resulting narrowing of the airways and an occlusive thrombus in the RIJ secondary to mass effect, for which radiation was initiated.   - 11/22/2020-11/22/2020: initial RT, 600 cGy in 2 fr to R supraclavicular *****  - 11/26/2020-11/28/2020: IMRT to supraclavicular node, mediastinal disease, and primary tumor, 800 cGy in 4 fr  - 12/02/2020-12/12/2020: IMRT accelerated given planned NSG procedure, 2500 cGy given in 10 fr   - 12/13/2021-01/01/2021: Admitted for planned elective management of ethmoid dural AVM, but found to have elevated LFTs and trop/CK elevations on admission, complete heart block, ultimately diagnosed with ***** myocarditis (biopsy-diagnosed) and hepatitis, s/p 5 days of pulse dose steroids and 3 injections of abatacept, as well as ***** ***** pacemaker placement for CHB.    -12/16/2020 CT chest: Compared with 11/20/2020, decreased size of RUL mass \"\nand right upper mediastinal/supraclavicular LAD Decreased mass effect on right brachiocephalic and right subclavian veins compared to prior. Chronic thrombosis of right IJ. Unchanged partially calcified anterior mediastinal soft tissue density may reflect metastatic LN vs thymoma given neurologic symptoms.   -12/16/2020 MRI brain: Punctate acute infarct within the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere. High risk right ethmoid dural AV fistula.   -12/30/2020 CT angiogram brain/neck: Asymmetric filling of the left cavernous sinus on CTA phase may reflect residual arteriovenous shunting. Relative narrowing of the right A1 segment compared to MRI of brain performed on 11/26/2020, which may reflect differences in technique versus vasospasm. Redemonstrated RUL mass grossly unchanged compared to 12/16/2020.  -01/20/2021 Cardiology follow up: troponin *****, recommend dose #4 abatacept while weaning steroids.  -01/20/2021 UCSF pathology review of OSH biopsies:    Right supraclavicular LN: metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, most likely NSCLC, possibly adenosquamous carcinoma.

EMG on 01/23/2021 consistent with myositis. Treated with ***** x5 doses, abatacept #4 on 01/24/2021. Discharged on prednisone 60 mg with plans for taper.   -01/23/2021 MRI brain: two punctate foci of enhancement in bilateral parietal lobes, new compared with 12/16/2020, suspicious for metastases. No acute abnormality of the orbits or signal abnormality of CN III, IV, or VI.  -01/23/2021 CT c/a/p: Compared to 12/16/2020, decreased mediastinal and supraclavicular \"\nlymphadenopathy as well as right anterior mediastinal soft tissue thickening. However, slight interval increase in size of the right upper lobe mass now measuring 2.9 cm (previously 2.3 x 2.1). Chronic thrombosis/stenosis of right internal jugular vein.     -January 28 and 01/28/2021 LPs: CSF cytology benign x2  -02/20/2021: Started sotorasib   -03/03/2021: GK to brain mets x2 (L parietal lobe and L hippocampus) 19 Gy to eac  -03/10/2021: Abatacept #5  -03/30/2021 CT c/a/p: Slight interval decrease in size of right upper lobe mass as well as decreased thickness of soft tissue nodule in the right upper lobe. Infiltrative soft tissue in the right paratracheal region has increased in density, which may reflect development of calcification. These findings likely reflect evolving posttreatment sequela. Unchanged ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe measuring 1.5 cm most suspicious for synchronous adenocarcinoma spectrum lesion. ***** in a/p.   -04/07/2021: Abatacept #6  -05/04/2021: Abatacept #7  -05/27/2021 CT c/a/p: Evidence of worsening malignancy including enlarging heterogeneously enhancing right upper lobe mass, right supraclavicular lymph node and mediastinal nodal conglomerate. Increased right upper lobe interlobular septal thickening may represent lymphatic spread of disease or lymphatic obstruction. Enlarging soft tissue mass in the right paraspinal musculature concerning for soft tissue metastasis. New small right pleural effusion of unclear etiology. Unchanged persistent ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe which may represent a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma lesion. New mixed lytic and sclerotic L2 vertebral body metastasis with a new expansile lytic component/soft tissue mass which invades the left psoas muscle and demonstrate significant mass effect on the thecal sac this measures approximately 4.8 x 3.4 cm  -06/10/2021 MRI L spine/brain: No new or enlarging intracranial metastasis. Evidence of treated \"\nprior intracranial metastasis. L2 vertebral body metastasis with pathologic compression fracture, involvement of the left psoas muscle, and epidural extension of metastasis resulting in mild spinal canal narrowing and severe right neuroforaminal narrowing. Additional small T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense lesions are present within the L3 and S2 vertebral bodies and are incompletely evaluated due to the absence of IV contrast and could reflect additional sites of metastases  -06/16/2021-06/18/2021: RT to L2 metastasis  -06/21/2021: Stopped sotorasib  -06/22/2021: C1 carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly start  -06/26/2021: Kyphoplasty, which took away some of the deep shooting pain.   -06/29/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -07/27/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -08/03/2021:carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -08/10/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly   -08/17/2021: carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly  -08/24/2021 CT c/a/p: Similar size of treated right upper lobe mass, with interval development of presumed postradiation scarring within the paramediastinal bilateral upper lobes. Increased soft tissue thickening adjacent to mass along the right upper hilum, with new obstruction of a traversing segmental right upper lobe  bronchus. Findings could also reflect evolving post radiation effects; however, close follow-up imaging is recommended. Increased moderate right pleural effusion. Increased size of supraclavicular and mediastinal masses. Decreased intensity of peripheral ***** of enhancement noted, although this may simply reflect differences in contrast bolus timing. Likely occluded right internal jugular vein. Redemonstrated L2 pathologic fracture, status post cement augmentation, with interval increased height loss at L2 and now L1 compared to 06/26/2021. Thickened segment of nondilated bowel in the central abdomen, nonspecific, and possibly reflecting *****, though treatment effects are also possible if there is history of \"\nradiation to this vicinity.   UCSF overread: Compared to 05/27/2021, significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as new or enlarging right paraspinal intramuscular masses. Findings are concerning for worsening metastatic disease. No significant change in right upper lobe mass however with increased architectural distortion, volume loss, and reticulation in the upper lobes anteriorly and *****. Findings are favored to represent postradiation change, recommend correlation with patient treatment history. Compared to 05/27/2021 interval pathologic compression fracture of the L2 vertebral body, with additional compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body as described above. Sclerosis within the L1 vertebral body may reflect sequela of mechanical adjacent segment fracture or an additional underlying osseous metastasis. Patient is status post vertebroplasty at these levels, with significant focal kyphosis and osseous narrowing of the spinal canal. The extraosseous component of tumor at L2 is significantly reduced in size from the prior exam, no longer conspicuous. No findings suspicious for new metastasis within the abdomen or pelvis.    INTERVAL HISTORY:  -09/02/2021: C1D1 gemcitabine  -09/09/2021: ***** gemcitabine held for mucositis   -09/11/2021 CT chest: In ER for hemoptysis. No acute pulmonary artery embolus. New ground-glass opacities in the right middle, right lower, and left lower lobes, could represent aspiration pneumonitis and/or infection. Compared to 08/24/2021, overall increase in burden of thoracic metastatic disease with persistent narrowing of the mid thoracic trachea and irregularity along the anterior aspect which could represent tracheal invasion. Correlation with bronchoscopy may be of benefit if not already performed. New lytic lesions in the posterior T2 and T3 vertebral bodies and increased size of right paraspinal soft tissue mass. \"\nDecreased size of small right pleural effusion.  -09/21/2021 FNA biopsy of right supraclavicular lymph node   Path: poorly differentiated carcinoma    ***** pending     -Edema in his lower extremities, maybe slightly worse again in the arms.  -He put on a few pounds  -He can feel the right paraspinal mass; feels like a muscle *****.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology, ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB 11 *****/mb), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed growth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He tolerated treatment well without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy showed a partial initial response. \"\nPrimary tumor was ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. However, he developed severe lower back pain in late April, and restaging CT c/a/p in 05/27/2021 confirmed significant worsening metastatic disease, with an increase in size of RUL primary tumor, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a new 4.6 cm L2 vertebral body osseous metastasis. He is s/p palliative RT to the spine, kyphoplasty for severe ongoing back pain, and 6 cycles of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel chemo, all locally up in *****. I've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Unfortunately, restaging CT c/a/p from 08/24/2021 showed cancer progression, in particular in the right supraclavicular lymph node, mediastinal lymph nodes, and a paraspinal intramuscular metastasis. I think there's been enough progression to merit a change in therapy, in particular because symptom-wise he is feeling worse too. He has been switched to gemcitabine and has received 1 dose so far. Day 8 dosing was held for neutropenia, and he also was seen in ***** ***** for hemoptysis and treated for a pneumonia. He is due for next infusion gemcitabine tomorrow with Dr. ***** in *****, with whom I am in communication about his treatment plan. I am also in discussions with Dr. ***** (local rad onc) about additional palliative RT to paraspinal mass, thoracic spine metastases, and possibly also right hilum to try to prevent hemoptysis and for pain palliation. Repeat biopsy of right supraclavicular LN shows poorly differentiated carcinoma; ***** NGS is pending.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed growth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He tolerated treatment well without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy showed a partial initial response. Primary tumor was ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. However, he developed severe lower back pain in late April, and restaging CT c/a/p in 05/27/2021 confirmed significant worsening metastatic disease, with \"\nan increase in size of RUL primary tumor, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a new 4.6 cm L2 vertebral body osseous metastasis. He has now undergone palliative RT to the spine, kyphoplasty for severe ongoing back pain, and is now s/p 2 cycles of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel chemo, all locally up in *****. I've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Continue with carboplatin/paclitaxel as systemic therapy; weekly at first to ensure tolerability. Tolerating weekly dosing with minimal side effects. Has large paratracheal node I suspect is contributing to ***** and swallowing difficulty with pressure on trachea that has not improved but also not gotten worse. His supraclavicular node is waxing and waning in size. He will come in next week to evaluate. Could stay at weekly or increase to *****. At this time will stay weekly. His back pain is significantly better after radiation and kyphoplasty. He will be restaged on 08/24/21 at ***** .  MRI brain with routine scans, at least every 3 months; next around August 2020    Supraclavicular mass approx same size as scan. Suspect ***** is due to mediastinal mass. Has pressure sores. Long discussion on nutrition and calories to help with healing. Discussion of performance status and maintaining current weight. Scans beginning of next month.    #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. He is s/p GK on 03/03/2021 to one parietal lesion and also lesion in L hippocampus. Brain MRI on 06/10/2021 shows no new or enlarging intracranial mets.   - MRI brain every 3 months or so; need to be coordinated around PPM. Next due around August 2020     #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged \"\nsteroid course, and abatacept x7. Given progressive lung cancer, no more abatacept doses are currently planned. Continue ***** 30 mg without further tapering until Troponin T normalizes. At this point, Trop-I normalized and Trop-T downtrending. ***** take time to rebuild cardiac muscle.  - Permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology for further monitoring and management.  - Further doses of abatacept on hold for now in light of cancer progression   -Continue prednisone 30 mg/day  -Continue trending Troponin T    #Bone metastases  Agree with starting zolendronic acid rather than alendronate for tolerability. This will be done locally in ***** after dental clearance.   Pt to confirm with dentist okay for bisphosphonates.   Local Oncologist to give monthly.     #Severe back pain  Unfortunately, the L2 metastasis is causing severe pain that has been difficult to manage and escalating quickly. Appreciate involvement of his local team for management.  -Continue regimen of APAP, methadone, oxycodone, and gabapentin per his local team  -Finally some improvement in severe symptoms after kyphoplasty, radiation     #Edema  Low threshold to get bilateral extremity ultrasound to r/o DVT. However, since also present in upper extremities, thrombosis seems less likely. September just reflect all the extra fluid he received with the procedure last week and chemo, in setting of low albumin. Other possibilities to consider if worsens are heart failure, or adenopathy impairing venous drainage.    - Consider further w/u if persists (DVT ultrasound, *****, ***** c/a/p)     #Immune-related myositis  Predominant symptom was bulbar weakness, although he also had more subtle widespread muscle weakness. Confirmed on EMG from 01/23/2021. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams. Continue prolonged steroid taper. He is down to prednisone 30 mg/day, will hold of on tapering further \"\n"},

New 4.6 cm expansile lytic lesion replacing the L2 vertebral  body with soft tissue component invading into the left psoas muscle.  Severe  lower back pain.  The patient's 06/10/2021 lumbar spine MR was reviewed.  Interventional radiology consultation was performed on 06/19/2021.    CONSENT:  The procedure and possible complications were explained to the patient and  written informed consent obtained. Complications include, but are not limited  to, bleeding, allergic reactions to injected medications, infection, adjacent  fracture, epidural cement extravasation, and local structure injury. While  these complications are unusual, they are possible.    MEDICATIONS:    General anesthesia provided by anesthesiology service.  Patient received  preprocedure 2 g IV ancef.    PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Maximal Sterile ***** Technique utilized.    The patient was placed in the prone position.  The area over the lumbar spine  was sterilely cleansed draped and anesthetized buffered 1% lidocaine and 0.5%  bupivacaine.  The L2 vertebral body pathologic fracture was localized by  fluoroscopy.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, bilateral transpedicular access was  obtained to the L2 vertebral body using an 11 gauge access needle.  Core bone  biopsies were obtained through the Osteo introducer needle.  This was followed  by sizing of the ablation zone using the specialized sizing needle and *****.  Subsequently, using 2 separate 20 mm ***** ***** ablation probes, ablation  was performed for 15 min.    After the ablation was complete, I placed coaxial 15 mm balloons creating a  cavity.  \"\nThe balloons were removed and barium impregnated PMMA ***** cement  was deployed into the vertebral body under direct fluoroscopic visualization  in the AP and lateral planes.  There was no evidence of significant leakage.  There was good interdigitation and filling of the vertebral body.  The  ablation probe on the left was then retracted to the level of the left pedicle  and an additional ablation was performed for 2 min, 30 sec on the left.    Both trocar needles removed with pressure held to hemostasis.  Dermatotomy  size closed with Dermabond.  Sterile dressings were applied there were no  immediate complications.    The patient was extubated from general anesthesia without complication and  transported to recovery.    PERFORMED PROCEDURES:  Fluoroscopic guided L2 kyphoplasty with spine tumor RF ablation  Fluoroscopic guided L2 bone biopsy  Total fluoroscopy time is 4.7 min.  Dose: 449 mGy.    IMPRESSION/PLAN:  1.

Vision blurry and a little worse. No problems so far with Lumakras about 1 week ago--Friday of last week. Since starting Lumakras everything has been stable. Reports that he is currently on a pureed diet, and progressing slowly to soft foods. Energy also continues to improve with progressing appetite. Denies fever, fatigue, chills, *****, dizziness, nasal/sinus congestion, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain/bloating, N/V/C/D, swelling, or numbness.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, here for follow up.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Unfortunately restaging scans  during recent hospitalization suggest he's had some interval progression, with growth in ***** primary tumor on CT from 01/23/2021 and two new parietal metastases on brain MRI from 01/23/2021. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy has gotten smaller, however.   - UCSF path review suggests poorly-differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma histology, which is a particularly aggressive NSCLC histologic subtype   - Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors  - Review scans and pathology at upcoming thoracic tumor board to confirm progression and whether to start next line of cancer-directed therapy now in light of his other active medical problems  - Most likely, given ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, I will recommend starting sotorasib as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. I have ordered this but have instructed him to hold off on picking it up until we finalize ***** at tumor board.  - When he \"\nstarts sotorasib, ***** ***** *****, and there are several precautions to take:   - No pepcid, zantac or other H2 blockers or PPIs -- he should stop lansoprazole before he starts sotorasib.    - Sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, may lower efficacy of prednisone (category C interaction); no empiric changes to prednisone taper but watch for worsening of symptoms after starting sotorasib    - If he is unable to swallow pills due to dysphagia: there is an option for dispersing tablets in water; sotorasib pills should not be crushed. Instructions discussed with patient: put 8 tablets in 120 mL room temperature, non-carbonated water. Slowly swirl mixture, do not shake, to disperse tablets into small pieces. Mixture should be pale yellow to light yellow in color, drink entire mixture immediately after dispersion   - Out of pocket cost is around $2500, patient given info about patient assistance program to help finance, and will wait to start until confirm TB recommendations and extent of growth on scans    - He will need close LFT monitoring after start, weekly initially and will be higher risk given recent hepatitis     - No DDI with IVIg or cellcept should that be required for his *****   - Can reserve more chemotherapy for next line of therapy    02/26/2021:   Patient began Lumakras, sotorasib, approximately one week ago. States that since starting Lumakras, symptoms have been stable.     #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. Not expected to be the cause of neurologic symptoms.   - Rad onc will schedule him for GK in the next few weeks.   - Sotorasib may have some CNS activity, but would still treat definitively with RT     #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x4.  \"\nTroponin downtrending but not yet normalized.   - Permanently discontinue checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology later today for further monitoring and management   - If he requires cellcept, not expected to have a drug-***** interaction with sotorasib   - Follow up EP for pacemaker assessment and interrogation    #Immune-related myositis  Now believed to be the cause of his bulbar weakness based on EMG results from 01/23/2021. CK is downtrending but may improvement in symptoms may lag. He is still very symptomatic with ongoing *****, dysarthria, dysphagia that are severely impacting QoL. Discussed with rheumatology and neuromuscular colleagues, I believe he may require additional therapy (e.g. IVIg) given lack of adequate improvement in his symptoms despite now two months of steroids and two course of high dose IV steroids. Appreciate involvement of rheum and neuromuscular teams.  - Follow up on February 11 with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - We will follow up on status of home OT/speech referrals, patient has not yet been scheduled     #Bulbar weakness   Ongoing diplopia with leftward gaze, dysphagia, dysarthria c/w severe bulbar muscle weakness. There was initially concern for multiple cranial nerve palsies (CN VI and IV) as the etiology of his symptoms  Versus possible ***** disease versus autoimmune process. Work up for myasthenic syndrome has been negative, appears anatomically remote from ethmoid dural AV fistula that was embolized, LP cytology negative x2. Now suspected due to more generalized myositis based on EMG results and the work up that was sent during his recent hospitalization. Impacting QoL.   - Rheum and neuromuscular clinic follow up next week   - Follow up results of pending tests form recent hospitalization  - I will review his scans at thoracic tumor board next week, also ask about the calcified mediastinal mass, query thymoma    - Agree with IVIg if \"\nrecommended, continue prednisone taper      #Immune-related hepatitis  LFTs fortunately have improved with steroids.  - CTM  - Could add cellcept if needed per hepatology consult in the hospital if fails to respond to steroids  - Follow up hepatology clinic in April 2021  - LFTs do not preclude sotorasib initiation but will need to monitor weekly after starting as he will be at higher risk of liver toxicity with treatment      #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Follow up with neuro angiography in 6 months to exclude recurrence (May 2021)      #Supportive care  S/p 2 covid vaccines - Pfizer, end of June and mid-July; wondering about timing of 3rd booster vaccine. He is eligible, but I will discuss with his care team about the timing in light of recent myocarditis. For now holding off.      #Supportive care:  Needs home OT, speech -- need to follow up on status, referred after discharge but not yet set up  Continue dysphagia diet for now   Optho for prisms  Vision therapy for diplopia? ***** valley optometry  Referred to nutrition given weight loss   Prefers Quest for labs    Advance care planning  Unknown if patient has named a surrogate decision maker. Provider deferred discussion.    RTC 2 weeks to check in (NP or Dr. *****)    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities     I spent a total of 45 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.

M h/o poorly differentiated lung carcinoma s/p cycle 1 of carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab on 11/17/2020 c/b multiple immune-related adverse events (myocarditis, myositis, and presumed hepatitis) requiring abatacept and steroid treatment. He presents to hepatology clinic for follow-up of his presumed ICI hepatitis.    He was found to have a high-risk dural AVF on brain MRI in November 2020 and presented for an embolization. While admitted, he endorsed diplopia for which Neurology was consulted. He was then incidentally discovered to have elevated liver tests (grade 3: ALT peak of 284, AST peak of 361, normal Tbili and only mildly elevated alk phos) and troponin and CK elevations. EKG showed intermittent complete heart block, and ICI myocarditis was definitively diagnosed following an endomyocardial biopsy on December 16 which demonstrated acute myocarditis. He had a PPM placed on December 18 for his heart block. He received pulse-dose steroids for 5 days starting on December 15, followed by prednisone 100 mg daily from December 20-January 01. He received three doses of abatacept 20 mg/kg (December 18, December 22, and January 01) for his severe myocarditis. At time of discharge, he was transitioned to prednisone 60 mg daily with plan for 5 mg taper weekly. He then represented on 01/22/2021 with progressive bulbar weakness and was diagnosed with ICI myositis, treated again with pulse-dose steroids for 5 days followed by prednisone 60 mg daily. He received an additional dose of abatacept on 01/24/2021 for his myocarditis. At the time of \"\nhis second admission, his liver tests had improved to grade 2 ICI hepatitis. His liver tests completely normalized on 02/25/2021 and have remained normal for the past two months. He remains on prednisone 50 mg currently as well as outpatient abatacept infusions as directed by Cardiology. He denies any history of significant alcohol use. No personal or family history of chronic liver disease. His liver tests prior to his cancer diagnosis were normal dating back to 2014. His abdominal imaging has shown no significant liver pathology other than focal fatty infiltration near the falciform ligament. His serum IgG was 475 in January. ANA positive, SMA negative. He currently denies abdominal pain, fever, chills, cough, CP, shortness of breath.

Pathology:  Endomyocardial biopsy 12/15/2020:  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS     A. Heart, endomyocardial biopsy:  Acute myocarditis, see comment.        COMMENT:  The biopsy consists of four fragments of endomyocardium.  Sections show  multifocal lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates with associated  cardiomyocyte injury ranging from acute (few days old) to subacute (more  than one week) chronicity.  Eosinophils are in insignificant numbers and  no giant cells are seen.       Immunohistochemical and histochemical stains were performed and  evaluated on block A1:  - Gomori trichrome: Highlights the early collagen formation in the  subacute foci.  - CD3: Highlights T-lymphocytes in moderate numbers in the acute and  subacute areas  - CD68: Highlights abundant macrophages/histiocytes that are more  numerous than the T-lymphocytes even in the acute areas.     Overall, the findings are those of acute myocarditis with a  lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, and this could be associated with the  usage of the immune checkpoint inhibitor Pembrolizumab (ref). Clinical  correlation is suggested.       ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ***** ***** ***** is a ***** y.o.

Imaging was unremarkable and did not demonstrate any metastatic liver lesions or biliary dilation. He denies alcohol use, no new medications (OTC or otherwise) other than his cancer treatment at that time. No supplements or herbal products. He was HAV negative, HBV negative (and nonimmune), HCV negative, EBV IgM negative, CMV PCR negative. Given his other serious immune-related adverse events, I suspect that his liver enzyme elevations were due to high-grade ICI hepatitis. His hepatitis has been well-treated as he received high-dose steroids and abatacept for his myocarditis. It is difficult to determine whether he would have developed true steroid-refractory hepatitis though his liver enzymes did not improve after 72 hours of pulse dose steroids. Following this, he received his first dose of abatacept for his myocarditis which ***** ***** would also treat his hepatitis. Reassuringly, his liver enzymes completely normalized at the beginning of February and have remained normal for the last two months.  Recommendations/Plan:  - From liver perspective, no need for further immunosuppressive therapy. Patient remains on prednisone and abatacept for his myocarditis (troponin still elevated); we defer to Cardiology regarding ongoing treatment and eventual steroid taper.  - Would continue to monitor liver tests when patient's prednisone is tapered, please re-refer to us if he develops recurrent elevated liver enzymes      Follow up: As needed    ATTESTATION:    My date of service is 05/07/2021. I was present for and performed key portions of the video visit. I am personally involved in the management of the patient. I agree with the findings and care plans as \"\ndocumented.     I spent a total of 55 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.     ***** ***** *****, MD    \"\n"},

IHC: TTF-1 and napsin negative. GATA3 negative. \"\nMucicarmine negative in tumor cells, but no glandular morphology seen on slide. *****/6 partial positive in subset of tumor cells, p16 negative. PD-L1 TPS < 1%.  - 11/17/2020: C1D1 carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab  - 11/20/2020 CT neck: Worsening supraclavicular and upper mediastinal lymphadenopathy with enlarging necrotic lymph nodes. Occlusive thrombus in right internal jugular vein, secondary to mass effects from right supraclavicular adenopathy.   - 11/20/2020 CT chest: Interval increase in size of masses within the RUL. Unchanged additional GGOs and solid nodule in *****. Worsening mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. Diffuse right chest wall subcutaneous edema.   - 11/23/2020 MRI brain: incidental 2.5 x 1 cm aneurysm of posterior communicating artery, no intracranial metastases.   Developed rapidly enlarging right supraclavicular LN conglomerate, as well as enlarged upper mediastinal lymph nodes, with resulting narrowing of the airways and an occlusive thrombus in the RIJ secondary to mass effect, for which radiation was initiated.   - 11/22/2020-11/22/2020: initial RT, 600 cGy in 2 fr to R supraclavicular *****  - 11/26/2020-11/28/2020: IMRT to supraclavicular node, mediastinal disease, and primary tumor, 800 cGy in 4 fr  - 12/02/2020-12/12/2020: IMRT accelerated given planned NSG procedure, 2500 cGy given in 10 fr   - 12/13/2021-01/01/2021: Admitted for planned elective management of ethmoid dural AVM, but found to have elevated LFTs and trop/CK elevations on admission, complete heart block, ultimately diagnosed with ***** myocarditis (biopsy-diagnosed) and hepatitis, s/p 5 days of pulse dose steroids and 3 injections of abatacept, as well as ***** ***** pacemaker placement for CHB.    -12/16/2020 CT chest: Compared with 11/20/2020, decreased size of RUL mass and right upper mediastinal/supraclavicular LAD Decreased mass effect on right brachiocephalic and right subclavian veins compared to prior. Chronic thrombosis of right IJ. Unchanged partially \"\ncalcified anterior mediastinal soft tissue density may reflect metastatic LN vs thymoma given neurologic symptoms.   -12/16/2020 MRI brain: Punctate acute infarct within the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere. High risk right ethmoid dural AV fistula.   -12/30/2020 CT angiogram brain/neck: Asymmetric filling of the left cavernous sinus on CTA phase may reflect residual arteriovenous shunting. Relative narrowing of the right A1 segment compared to MRI of brain performed on 11/26/2020, which may reflect differences in technique versus vasospasm. Redemonstrated RUL mass grossly unchanged compared to 12/16/2020.  -01/20/2021 Cardiology follow up: troponin *****, recommend dose #4 abatacept while weaning steroids.  -01/20/2021 UCSF pathology review of OSH biopsies:    Right supraclavicular LN: metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, most likely NSCLC, possibly adenosquamous carcinoma. IHC: TTF-1 (-), Napsin A (-), PD-L1 <1%; ***** (-), CK7 (+), P63 (+)   Left axillary LN:  Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.

EMG on 01/23/2021 consistent with myositis. Treated with ***** x5 doses, abatacept #4 on 01/24/2021. Discharged on prednisone 60 mg with plans for taper.   -01/23/2021 MRI brain: two punctate foci of enhancement in bilateral parietal lobes, new compared with 12/16/2020, suspicious for metastases. No acute abnormality of the orbits or signal abnormality of CN III, IV, or VI.  -01/23/2021 CT c/a/p: Compared to 12/16/2020, decreased mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy as well as right anterior mediastinal soft tissue thickening. However, slight interval increase in size of the right upper lobe mass now measuring 2.9 cm (previously 2.3 x 2.1). Chronic \"\nthrombosis/stenosis of right internal jugular vein.     -January 28 and 01/28/2021 LPs: CSF cytology benign x2  -02/20/2021: Started sotorasib   -03/03/2021: GK to brain mets x2 (L parietal lobe and L hippocampus) 19 Gy to eac  -03/10/2021: Abatacept #5    INTERVAL HISTORY:  -03/30/2021 CT c/a/p: Slight interval decrease in size of right upper lobe mass as well as decreased thickness of soft tissue nodule in the right upper lobe. Infiltrative soft tissue in the right paratracheal region has increased in density, which may reflect development of calcification. These findings likely reflect evolving posttreatment sequela.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung \"\n(likely adenosquamous histology), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN on PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Unfortunately restaging scans in January showed growth in ***** primary tumor in the RUL and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy has gotten smaller, however. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Given the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He is tolerating treatment well so far without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy show a partial initial response. Primary tumor is ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. We've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Continue sotorasib 960 mg daily; tolerating well. Reserving chemo for next line of therapy.   Can space out labs to every 3 weeks from an oncology standpoint   Restaging scans (CT c/a/p) in 9-12 weeks (order at future visit)  MRI brain in 3 months per rad onc (around mid-May 2021)   Precautions on sotorasib:       - No pepcid, zantac or other H2 blockers or PPIs -- he should stop lansoprazole before he starts sotorasib.        - Sotorasib is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, may lower efficacy of prednisone (category C interaction); no empiric changes to \"\nprednisone taper but watch for worsening of symptoms after starting sotorasib        - If he is unable to swallow pills due to dysphagia: there is an option for dispersing tablets in water; sotorasib pills should not be crushed. Instructions discussed with patient: put 8 tablets in 120 mL room temperature, non-carbonated water. Slowly swirl mixture, do not shake, to disperse tablets into small pieces. Mixture should be pale yellow to light yellow in color, drink entire mixture immediately after dispersion. Fortunately swallowing is improving.         - He will need close LFT monitoring after start, as will be higher risk given recent hepatitis. ***** out to q3 weeks now given normalization of LFTs.         - No DDI with IVIg or cellcept should that be required for his *****     #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. Not expected to be the cause of neurologic symptoms. He is s/p GK on 03/03/2021 to one parietal lesion and also lesion in L hippocampus.   - Sotorasib may have some CNS activity  - Include MRI on next set of routine restaging scans in May. ***** need to coordinate around PPM.      #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x5.  Troponin downtrending, Trop-I normalized and Trop-T downtrending. ***** take time to rebuild cardiac muscle.  - Permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology for further monitoring and management with abatacept. Appreciate co-management.   - If he requires cellcept, not expected to have a drug-***** interaction with sotorasib   - Follow up EP for pacemaker assessment and interrogation  - ***** ask cardiology whether he can stop using CPAP machine, believe intention was for 4-6 weeks of use only to prevent apnea in s/o \"\nrespiratory muscle weakness     #Immune-related myositis  Predominant symptom was bulbar weakness, although also had more subtle widespread muscle weakness. Confirmed on EMG from 01/23/2021. His symptoms are finally turning a corner. His dysarthria is clearly improved and he reports less dysphagia as well, gaining back 18 lbs. Voice is stronger, swallowing is improving. Still with some double vision due to dysconjugate gaze, now has prism correction glasses, working with OT for continued bulbar and occular muscle strengthening. Discussed with rheumatology and neuromuscular colleagues and cardio-onc team. IVIg may theoretically interfere with abatacept action. For now, given improvement in his symptoms with time and steroids, we have been holding off on IVIg--but could always revisit in the future depending on trajectory. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams. Continue prolonged steroid taper.   - Follow up with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - Continue prednisone taper per rheum  - PT/OT, vision therapy      #Immune-related hepatitis  LFTs fortunately have resolved with steroids.  - CTM  - Follow up hepatology clinic in April 2021     #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Follow up with neuro angiography in 6 months to exclude recurrence (May 2021) -- he will need an enoxaparin bridge with eliquis held for 72 hours before procedure and restarted 24 hours afterwards. I will coordinate at his next appointment.      #Low TSH  Referred to endocrine given multiple other *****.      #Supportive care  S/p 2 covid vaccines - Pfizer, end of June and mid-July; holding off on 3rd vaccine in light of recent *****.  I encouraged flu shot now.     #Supportive care:  Continue home OT, speech  Appreciate speech involvement given dysphagia   Optho for prism correction \"\nglasses--done  Vision therapy for diplopia--ongoing   PT/OT  Referred to nutrition given weight loss; now improving  Prefers Quest for labs    Advance care planning  Unknown if patient has named a surrogate decision maker.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung (likely adenosquamous histology), here for follow up.     #Poorly differentiated lung adenosquamous carcinoma  Stage IV at diagnosis with involvement of hilar, bilateral mediastinal, right supraclavicular, and left axillary LN \"\non PET. ***** *****, PD-L1 0%, TMB-high (11 *****/mb). Complicated course with multiple severe ***** after one cycle carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab; see notes and admissions for more details. He was also treated with IMRT to supraclavicular nodal, mediastinal disease, and RUL primary tumor in November 2020. Given severe grade 4 ***** from pembrolizumab, we have permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately restaging scans in January 2021 while off therapy for ***** recovery showed growth in ***** primary tumor and two new suspected parietal metastases on brain MRI. Mediastinal adenopathy and supraclavicular adenopathy had gotten smaller, however. Because of the ***** ***** mutation identified on ***** NGS, he was started on sotorasib on 02/20/2021. We selected this as next line of therapy over chemo to give him a break from more intensive therapy. He tolerated treatment well without clear side effects. Initial restaging scans after 6 weeks of therapy showed a partial initial response. Primary tumor is ***** smaller, no changes to LN and no other sites of *****. However, he developed severe lower back pain in late April, and restaging CT c/a/p in 05/27/2021 confirmed significant worsening metastatic disease, with an increase in size of RUL primary tumor, mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a new 4.6 cm L2 vertebral body osseous metastasis. He will undergo a course of palliative RT to the spine starting tomorrow, and chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel (weekly at first) to begin next week, both locally up in *****.   We've had several ***** discussions with his rheumatologist, neurologist, and cardiologist to coordinate his treatment plan.     Discussed that he can stop sotorasib right before starting chemotherapy next Monday.  Plan to start carboplatin/paclitaxel as next line of systemic therapy; weekly at first to ensure tolerability. I have been in touch with his local oncologist. \"\nDr *****, who will administer this treatment.   Palliative RT to L2 metastases planned to start tomorrow in *****.   Restaging scans after ~2 cycles to assess initial response; these can be done locally if easier logistically  MRI brain with routine scans, at least every 3 months     #Brain metastases  Two punctuate parietal lobe lesions on MRI brain from 01/23/2021 suspicious for new metastases. He is s/p GK on 03/03/2021 to one parietal lesion and also lesion in L hippocampus. Brain MRI on 06/10/2021 shows no new or enlarging intracranial mets.   - MRI brain every 3 months or so; need to be coordinated around PPM     #Immune-related myocarditis  Severe grade 4 ***** after single dose of pembrolizumab resulting in complete heart block, requiring PPM placement, management in *****, prolonged steroid course, and abatacept x7. Given progressive lung cancer, no more abatacept doses are currently planned. Continue ***** 30 mg without further tapering until Troponin T normalizes. At this point, Trop-I normalized and Trop-T downtrending. ***** take time to rebuild cardiac muscle.  - Permanently discontinued checkpoint inhibitors   - Follow up cardio-oncology for further monitoring and management.  - Further doses of abatacept on hold for now  -Continue prednisone 30 mg/day  -Continue trending Troponin T    #Bone metastases  Agree with starting zolendronic acid rather than alendronate for tolerability. This will be done locally in ***** after dental clearance.     #Severe back pain  Unfortunately, the L2 metastasis is causing severe pain that has been difficult to manage and escalating quickly. Appreciate involvement of his local team for management.  -Continue regimen of APAP, methadone, and oxycodone per his local team  -Likely needs further uptitration of his regimen; no sleepiness and still having severe March 01 pain. He will follow up with local team today.     #Immune-related myositis  Predominant symptom was bulbar \"\nweakness, although he also had more subtle widespread muscle weakness. Confirmed on EMG from 01/23/2021. Greatly appreciate involvement and co-management of rheum and neuromuscular teams. Continue prolonged steroid taper. He is down to prednisone 30 mg/day, will hold of on tapering further until troponin T normalizes.   - Follow up with rheum and neuromuscular clinics for further management.   - Continue prednisone 30 mg/day for now until Troponin T normalizes  - PT/OT, vision therapy      #Immune-related hepatitis  LFTs fortunately have resolved with steroids.  - CTM     #Ethmoid dural AV fistula  Incidental finding on brain MRI for cancer staging, now s/p embolization on December 21 and December 25.   - Follow up with neuro angiography in 6 months without evidence of recurrence (May 2021)    #Low appetite  Continue ensure./boost nutritional supplements. Also discussed mirtazepine as a possible approach to help with both insomnia and low appetite.     #Right IJ thrombus  Occlusive thrombus in right internal jugular vein, secondary to mass effects from right supraclavicular adenopathy, on eliquis.     #Low TSH  Referred to endocrine given multiple other ***** They feel like he had subclinical hyperthyroidism and now heading towards hypothyroidism consistent with thyroiditis. He may need thyroid replacement but they will continue monitoring with TFTs in 4-6 weeks.       #Supportive care  S/p 2 covid vaccines - Pfizer, end of June and mid-July; I confirmed with cardiology that we should still hold off on 3rd vaccine in light of recent myocarditis and ongoing elevated troponin T  Flu vaccine done 04/01/2021     #Supportive care:  Appreciate speech involvement given dysphagia.

Assessment:  ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. male with ***** ***** lung adenocarcinoma, s/p carbo/pemetrexed/***** maintenance pemetrexed/pembrolizumab, palliative radiation to left scapula (8Gyx1, 12/31/20) and left mandible metastasis 40 Gy in 10 fractions with hyperthermia completed 04/15/2021. Now with metabolic progression by FDG PET but anatomic extent of disease has been fairly stable. Planning to switch to sotorasib with Dr. *****.    He was last seen in our department on 07/22/21. Here for follow-up to discuss palliative RT for back pain.   Pain is 03/11/10 in the low back radiating to right leg. He was taking percocet but now oxycodone with adequate control.   The other bone metastases are not painful.    For the right hip I'd recommend IMRT 30-40 Gy in 10 fractions, similar to what was used for his left mandible metastasis in April 2021. I don't think this is urgent and since he's starting targeted therapy soon, it can wait to see if his pain improves with targeted therapy alone.    Plan:  1. No plans for radiation  2. If needed in the future for right hip/back pain I'd suggest 10 fractions over 2 weeks given large size of the metastasis  3. Anticipate sotorasib with Dr. *****  4.

MRI face/naso neck was roughly stable but limited by patient motion, and MRI brain not done. He went off after C9 as per below. Interval PET/CT and MRI face/naso/neck which showed slightly decreased size of L facial mass but concern for increasing avidity of existing osseous mets on PET, although no new bone mets. Overall though these findings are concerning for ongoing disease progression at least metabolically. Opted for sotorasib at this juncture.

He occasionally also has tingling down his bilateral anterior thighs which was more severe over the weekend such that he had difficulty going up the stairs, but this is much improved today.

Imaging after 9 cycles of maintenance pemetrexed/pembrolizumab showed stable lung and bone disease without clear progression. MRI face/naso neck was roughly stable but limited by patient motion, and MRI brain not done. He went off after C9 as per below.    Previously we reviewed interval PET/CT and MRI face/naso/neck which showed slightly decreased size of L facial mass but concern for increasing avidity of existing osseous mets on PET, although no new bone mets. Overall though these findings ***** concerning for ongoing disease progression at least metabolically.     We opted to start sotorasib, which he started in the interim (though with an interruption due to coverage/copay issues) and which he is tolerating well.    Today we reviewed imaging that is reassuring for stability of head/neck and thoracic (even some slight increase in pulmonary lesion) and bony disease. There is not significant reduction in size, but this has been a short duration on therapy. Notably he has had improvement in bone pain, which might suggest systemic benefit.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 \"\nyears old Male with history of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with separate primary versus metastatic parotid adenocarcinoma diagnosed in 2020/2021 with widespread osseous metastases.  CURRENT THERAPY AND DATE INITIATED: Sotorasib October 2022 TECHNIQUE: Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours. Following the radiopharmaceutical, a low dose, non-contrast, nondiagnostic CT was obtained for attenuation correction purposes. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 54 minutes after FDG injection. PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data. PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted. Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images. Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 107 mg/dL.

Also s/p palliative rads to L scapula December 27, L mandible met April 26, R 6th rib April 28    # NSCLC. Imaging after 9 cycles of maintenance pemetrexed/pembrolizumab showed stable lung and bone disease without clear progression. MRI face/naso neck was roughly stable but limited by patient motion, and MRI brain not done. Then PET/CT and MRI face/naso/neck showed slightly decreased size of L facial mass but concern for increasing avidity of existing osseous mets on PET, although no new bone mets. Overall though these findings ***** concerning for ongoing disease progression at least metabolically.     We opted to start sotorasib and first imaging November 2022 after initiation was reassuring for stability of head/neck and thoracic (even some slight increase in pulmonary lesion) and bony disease. There was not significant reduction in size, but this had been a short duration on therapy. Notably he has had improvement in bone pain, which might suggest systemic benefit. Imaging February 2023 showed overall stable disease burden in lungs, some improving areas of avidity in bones, but three osseous mets with increasing avidity and minimally increased tumor size (R rib, L5, & L posterior acetabulum).

CLINICAL HISTORY: ***** years old Male with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma status post carboplatin, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, subsequently maintenance pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, now on *****, status post \"\nradiation therapy to the right sixth rib and left mandible..      CURRENT THERAPY AND DATE INITIATED: 10/12/2022     TECHNIQUE: Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours. Following the radiopharmaceutical, a nondiagnostic, low dose CT was performed for localization and attenuation correction purposes. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 48 minutes after FDG injection. PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data. PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted. Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images. Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 101 mg/dL. For further details on simultaneously acquired diagnostic CT imaging, see separately dictated report.

Lungs: See above Abdominal and pelvic organs: No metastases. Bones: Similar size but increasing hypermetabolism of a L5 vertebral body lesion. The previously noted left acetabular lesion is not significantly changed. Numerous additional sclerotic lesions demonstrate no significant hypermetabolism. Other: No metastases.     Non-oncologic findings:     Brain:  Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. No mass effect.     Neck:   The previously noted left parotid lesion demonstrating low-level hypermetabolism is not well evaluated.     Chest:   Severe coronary artery atherosclerotic calcifications. Mitral annular calcifications. Mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening.     Abdomen/Pelvis:   Atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta and its branches.     Musculoskeletal:   Multiple right-sided rib fractures.             1.  Increasing hypermetabolism within an L5 vertebral body and left glenoid lesion with unchanged CT appearance. Hypermetabolic right lateral sixth rib metastatic lesion is slightly less hypermetabolic following radiation therapy. Otherwise, similar size and hypermetabolism of a right upper lobe spiculated nodule and additional osseous metastatic lesions. No new sites of metastatic disease. 2.

Then PET/CT and MRI face/naso/neck showed slightly decreased size of L facial mass but concern for increasing avidity of existing osseous mets on PET, although no new bone mets. Overall though these findings ***** concerning for ongoing disease progression at least metabolically.     We opted to start sotorasib and first imaging November 2022 after initiation was reassuring for stability of head/neck and thoracic (even some slight increase in pulmonary lesion) and bony disease. There was not significant reduction in size, but this had been a short duration on therapy. Notably he has had improvement in bone pain, which might suggest systemic benefit. Imaging February 2023 showed overall stable disease burden in lungs, some improving areas of avidity in bones, but three osseous mets with increasing avidity and minimally increased tumor size (R rib, L5, & L posterior acetabulum). He had some pain to correlate to R rib mass but not L5 or hip. He had radiation to the R 6th rib with \"\nextent/intensity of known osseous and nodal mets, favor worsening metastatic disease. Known rib mets with similar extent of hypermetabolism with decreased intensity. RUL nodule stable, not avid.  -06/29/23 ***** brain/face/naso/neck: No intracranial metastatic disease.

Following the radiopharmaceutical, a nondiagnostic, low dose CT was performed for localization and attenuation correction purposes. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 50 minutes after FDG injection. PET images were corrected for attenuation using \"\nthe CT transmission data. PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted. Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images. Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 93 mg/dL.

Imaging after 9 cycles of maintenance pemetrexed/pembrolizumab showed stable lung and bone disease without clear progression. MRI face/naso neck was roughly stable but limited by patient motion, and MRI brain not done. Then PET/CT and MRI face/naso/neck showed slightly decreased size of L facial mass but concern for increasing avidity of existing osseous mets on PET, although no new bone mets. Overall though these findings ***** concerning for ongoing disease progression at least metabolically.     We opted to start sotorasib and first imaging November 2022 after initiation was reassuring for stability of head/neck and thoracic (even some slight increase in pulmonary lesion) and bony disease. There was not significant reduction in size, but this had been a short duration on therapy. Notably he has had improvement in bone pain, which might suggest systemic benefit. Imaging February 2023 showed overall stable disease burden in lungs, some improving areas of avidity in bones, but three osseous mets with increasing avidity and minimally increased tumor size (R rib, L5, & L posterior acetabulum).

My location is in a UCSF clinical facility.    Assessment:     IDENTIFICATION:  ***** y.o. male with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma involving bone with either metastatic or second primary parotid adenocarcinoma, ***** ***** mutation, s/p carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab x 4, then maintenance pemetrexed and ***** x 9 (last October 26), stopped for anemia and renal failure leading to admission.    # NSCLC. Imaging after 9 cycles of maintenance pemetrexed/pembrolizumab showed stable lung and bone disease without clear progression. MRI face/naso neck was roughly stable but limited by patient motion, and MRI brain not done. He went off after C9 as per below. Interval PET/CT and MRI face/naso/neck which showed slightly decreased size of L facial mass but concern for increasing avidity of existing osseous mets on PET, although no new bone mets. Overall though these findings are concerning for ongoing disease progression at least metabolically.     Opted for sotorasib at this juncture. Planning travel October 19-November 03, tentative plan to start prior to trip to give him a few weeks to get used to any side effects before traveling. Feels good on medication. ***** was great. Tired and thinks having a wheelchair will be helpful.    ***** the line at time of future progression, can reconsider ***** alone, versus other chemotherapy options including docetaxel and gemcitabine. Would not rechallenge with pemetrexed..    #Neck mass swelling  - Appears larger/growing in size  - Scans 12/02/22, follow up \"\nHypertension 12/25/2015    Daily medication   • Lung cancer metastatic to bone (CMS code) 12/23/2020   • Lung cancer metastatic to bone (CMS code)    • Peripheral vascular disease with claudication (CMS code)    • Prostate cancer (CMS code) 08/06/2013    Prostate removed     Past Surgical History:   Procedure Laterality Date   • HERNIA REPAIR  11/20/2015    Repaired   • PROSTATE SURGERY  February 2014    Removed   • VASECTOMY  2008       Allergies/Contraindications  No Known Allergies   Current Medications       Dosage    aspirin 81 mg EC tablet Take 1 tablet (81 mg total) by mouth daily Please take with food    diazePAM (VALIUM) 5 mg tablet Take 5mg one hour prior to MRI.    diphenoxylate-atropine (LOMOTIL) 2.5-0.025 mg tablet Take 1 tablet by mouth 4 (four) times daily as needed for Diarrhea    epoetin alfa-EPBX (RETACRIT) 10,000 unit/mL injection Inject 0.5 mL (5,000 Units total) under the skin every 7 (seven) days.

We discussed the pathological diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma based on review of her outside pathology with *****+. I don't think NGS and PD-L1 were sent with that original sample, or at least I don't have record of these, but NGS was done via ***** at progression with finding of ***** ***** mutation.    We then discussed staging. Based on pleural and bony involvement, the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.    We then discussed treatment options. I noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. For tumors driven by ***** *****, I would generally recommend first line chemo/immunotherapy:  --I agree with her having received the KEYNOTE-189 regimen of carboplatin and pemetrexed with pembrolizumab given IV every 3 weeks x 4 cycles, then maintenance pemetrexed and pembrolizumab up to 2 years, which was shown to have superior OS compared to chemo alone. Unfortunately she had progression after 3 cycles albeit with mixed response and a delay to C3, so it might be worth considering this or other 1st line regimens again in the future.  --If PD-L1>=50%, we could also consider pembrolizumab alone per KEYNOTE-024, though the response rate is somewhat lower than 189, so I tend to prefer this when a patient isn't too symptomatic and/or their burden of disease isn't too large (such that we will likely have the opportunity to add chemo after 2 cycles if not effective).   --A more recently available \"\noption would be double immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab per *****-***** (potentially also with 2 doses of chemotherapy initially per CM-9LA) which could be appealing in a patient who declines chemo (or *****/limited course ***** with 4 cycles of chemo per AEGEAN).    For second line therapy, she was appropriately moved to ***** (either this or adagrasib would be reasonable here). I agree with plans for imaging no later than 2-3 mos on therapy, with earlier check of labs for hepatotoxicity especially. I recommend she stay on until progression or intolerance.    At next progression, I encouraged her to be in touch if she were interested in another consultation. Options could include:  --standard chemo-- likely docetaxel +/- ramucirumab (vs other single agents)  --***** trials for after 1st gen inhibitors like sotorasib  --return to 1st line regimens as above given mixed response and delay to C3 in her case, including chemo immunotherapy or double immunotherapy, eg *****/ipi    # Bone metastatic disease. We discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ especially given her implant history. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses.     # Supportive care. I encouraged the patient to be forthright about symptoms as they arise so they can be addressed.

We opted to start sotorasib and first imaging November 2022 after initiation was reassuring for stability of head/neck and thoracic (even some slight increase in pulmonary lesion) and bony disease. There was not significant reduction in size, but this had been a short duration on therapy. Notably he has had improvement in bone pain, which might suggest systemic benefit. Imaging February 2023 showed overall stable disease burden in lungs, some improving areas of avidity in bones, but three osseous mets with increasing avidity and minimally increased tumor size (R rib, L5, & L posterior acetabulum).

Imaging after 9 cycles of maintenance pemetrexed/pembrolizumab showed stable lung and bone disease without clear progression. MRI face/naso neck was roughly stable but limited by patient motion, and MRI brain not done. He went off after C9 as per below.    Previously we reviewed interval PET/CT and MRI face/naso/neck which showed slightly decreased size of L facial mass but concern for increasing avidity of existing osseous mets on PET, although no new bone mets. Overall though these findings ***** concerning for ongoing disease progression at least metabolically.     We opted to start sotorasib and first imaging after initiation was reassuring for stability of head/neck and thoracic (even some slight increase in pulmonary lesion) and bony disease. There is not significant reduction in size, but this has been a short duration on therapy. Notably he has had improvement in bone pain, which might suggest systemic benefit.    Today we reviewed updated PET/CT which showed overall stable disease burden in lungs, some improving areas of avidity in bones, but three osseous mets with increasing avidity and minimally increased tumor size (R rib, L5, & L posterior acetabulum).

MR Brain with and without Contrast    Result Date: 03/03/2023  ***** BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, MR FACE, NASO, NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  03/02/2023 1:58 PM INDICATION (as provided by referring clinician): Lung cancer primary, metastatic to other region Renal function impairment (eGFR less than 30) Intracranial malignant neoplasm care Metastatic lung (+/- h/n cancer)--eval after 2 more mos on therapy ADDITIONAL HISTORY: metastatic lung adenocarcinoma involving bone with either metastatic or second primary parotid adenocarcinoma, ***** ***** mutation, s/p carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab x 4, then maintenance pemetrexed and ***** x 9 (last October 26), stopped for anemia and renal failure leading to admission. COMPARISON: MR brain and face 12/01/2022. TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the brain were acquired at 3.0 tesla. MEDICATIONS: Dotarem - 12 mL - Intravenous FINDINGS: MR brain: No acute hemorrhage. No herniation. Marked periventricular and deep white matter foci of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity, nonspecific, likely related to senescent change. No reduced diffusion. Scattered microhemorrhages in the right periatrial white matter, bilateral thalamus, and left centrum semiovale is unchanged. No abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal, or dural enhancement. Ventricles within normal limits of size for age. No extra-axial collection. Bilateral mastoid effusions. Patchy mucositis thickening, decreased compared to 12/01/2022. MR face: Unchanged heterogeneously enhancing ossified mass \"\ncentered in the left mandibular angle/ramus with associated soft tissue component extending to the masticator space and displacing the parapharyngeal and buccal fat.This mass again measures approximately 6.1 x 5.2 x 5.0 cm (AP x TV x CC), which is unchanged compared to the prior study from 12/01/2022 when accounting for differences in measurement acquisition technique. Separate T2 hyperintense 1.5 x 1.4 cm left parapharyngeal soft tissue lesion (series 11, image *****) is unchanged dating back to priors from 2020. No new or enlarging mass or fluid collection in the neck. The left internal jugular vein is again not visualized. Otherwise, the major cervical flow voids are maintained.     1. No intracranial metastatic disease. 2. Compared to 12/01/2022, unchanged large ossified/calcified mass centered in the left mandibular ramus/angle and extending into the masticator space. The ossific/calcific component is better seen on same day PET/CT. 3. Circumscribed 1.5 cm multilobulated T2 hyperintense left parapharyngeal space soft tissue lesion, unchanged since 2020, favored to represent a benign lesion.

CLINICAL HISTORY: ***** years old Male with history of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with separate primary versus metastatic parotid adenocarcinoma.  CURRENT THERAPY AND DATE INITIATED: Sotorasib, started December 2022 TECHNIQUE: Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours. Following the radiopharmaceutical, a nondiagnostic, low dose CT was performed for localization and attenuation correction purposes. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 66 minutes after FDG injection. PET images were \"\ncorrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data. PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted. Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images. Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 84 mg/dL. For further details on simultaneously acquired diagnostic CT imaging, see separately dictated report.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with stage IV lung squamous cell carcinoma (PD-L1 5%, ***** ***** mutation), metastatic to the pleura and the bones, here for medical oncology consultation for a second opinion. Primary treatment at ***** in ***** *****.     He is s/p 4 cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel (last 2 concurrent with \"\npembrolizumab). Restaging scans after chemo showed a partial response with decreased size of RLL cavitary mass and right hilar lymphadenopathy, grossly stable size of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. He was then transitioned to ***** maintenance and completed 3 cycles. Unfortunately, he has developed recurrent symptoms of hemoptysis and CT angiogram in 08/18/2021 showed progression with increased size of right hilar mass with airway invasion, increased size of a subcarinal lymph node and increased RLL cavitary mass (along with new hemorrhage in the RML). Bone scan also shows a new right iliac bone metastasis.      Admitted locally on 09/05/2021 for worsened dyspnea. Repeat imaging showed ongoing cancer progression in right hilar mass with complete right lung opacification and rightward mediastinal shift. He underwent bronchoscopy on 09/09/2021 locally with endoscopic tumor ablation and is s/p a course of palliative RT to the right hilum, completed on 09/27/2021. He then sotorasib as systemic therapy on 10/01/2021. Today we reviewed his interval restaging CT scans from 11/26/2021. Compared to prior scans, there has been significant interval improvement in the aeration of the right lung due to local therapies (mechanical debridement, RT) to the right hilar tumor this last *****. However, outside the right lung there are findings that are worrisome for cancer progression. In particular, there are several new small nodules ***** the left lower lobe worrisome for metastatic disease, along with an increase in size of left iliac bone metastasis (although last prior CT a/p for comparison was several months prior to start of sotorasib). Given the new left lung findings and increased pain in left hip, I agree with his local oncologist that change in therapy in indicated. I agree with his local oncologist's plan for switching to gemcitabine next. Reasonable to try the combination of carboplatin/gemcitabine first and then drop \"\nthe carboplatin if his neuropathy worsens. I would favor this regimen over docetaxel +- ramucirumab, mostly because of potential for hemorrhage with ramucirumab given the right hilar mass is narrowing/encasing the right pulmonary artery. Dr. ***** is in the process of arranging for carboplatin/gemcitabine treatment locally. I am happy to see Mr. ***** back at the time of his next scans in the next 2 months or so to check in.      He also has a history of prostate cancer s/p neoadjuvant ***** and lupron and radical prostatectomy.     #Lung SCC   Stage IV squamous cell carcinoma with bone and pleural metastases (***** *****, PD-L1 5%). Tumor content on Strata NGS was technically less than the limit of detection for the assay, but the identification of a ***** mutation makes another actionable co-alteration very unlikely as ***** ***** mutations are largely exclusive of EGFR, ALK, ***** mutations. He completed 4 cycles of carboplatin/*****, including C3-4 with concurrent pembrolizumab.  Restaging scans following chemotherapy show an initial response to treatment. He was then transitioned to maintenance ***** and is s/p 3 cycles. Unfortunately, he developed recurrent hemoptysis similar to his symptoms at diagnosis, and restaging CT chest confirmed progression in right hilar mass and RLL cavitary mass. He also has a new right iliac bone met. He underwent bronchoscopy with mechanical tumor debridement/ablation for worsened dyspnea on 09/09/2021 and completed a course of palliative RT to the right hilum from 09/13/2021-09/27/2021. Systemic therapy was switched to sotorasib on 10/01/2021. Today we reviewed restaging scans from 11/26/2021, which show improvement in aeration of right lung, stable mediastinal lymph nodes but with multiple new solid and cavitary nodules throughout the left lung concerning for metastatic disease, and worsening of a left iliac metastasis.    -Recommend sending any biopsy specimen from bronchoscopy \"\non 09/09/2021 for repeat NGS and PD-L1 given low tumor quantity on first biopsy; I will follow up with Dr. ***** to determine whether this was done. If note, low threshold to repeat biopsy down the line and/or send ***** to guide treatment moving forward.    -Restaging scans with multiple new left lung nodule concerning for progression of systemic disease; although there is improved aeration of right lung following mechanical debridement in August 2021 and RT, and stable mediastinal adenopathy.   -Agree with stopping sotorasib and switching to either SoC chemotherapy or a clinical trial now given multiple new nodules in left lung worrisome for progression and new/worsened left hip metastasis   -SoC options: either gemcitabine +/- carboplatin (preferred) versus ***** +/- ramucirumab (but I'd worry about hemorrhage potential with ramucirumab, so agree with local onc for carboplatin/*****)   -Clinical trial option at *****: *****-*****, efficacy and safety of ***** in combination with investigational agents in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Current investigational agent is an ILT-3 inhibitor. However, his borderline PS is an issue and he would need to be treated here at *****. Discussed today and he would prefer to get a proven treatment right now.   -CT scans after ~6 to 8 weeks on therapy to ensure evidence of an initial response  -He has been clear that quality of life is an important consideration moving forward with decisions about treatment  -He has now established care with SMS team locally   -I will discuss these recommendations with his local oncologist, Dr. *****     #Bone metastatic disease  We previously discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommended use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or zoledronic acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo \"\nthereafter. I recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses.   - I agree with plan for palliative RT to left hip bone metastases for pain control   - Denosumab or zolendronic, with dental clearance prior  - Ca, vitamin D    #Bone pain  -Cymbalta 30 mg daily  -Dilaudid 1 mg q4H prn   -Ibuprofen TID  - Managed by SMS team locally     #Right thalamic lesion  UCSF overread of ***** MRI brain done, agree with new 7 mm right thalamic focus of enhancement, but be subacute infarct but recommend follow up short interval MRI brain to rule out metastasis.   - MRI brain in ~6 weeks or so to rule out brain met  - Depending on how he responds to next line of NSCLC treatment and goals of care, consider work up for stroke risk (TTE, *****, carotid ultrasound)     #Prostate cancer  S/p lupron, followed by prostatectomy in November 2020, *****, GS 4+3. Biochemical recurrence in February 2021.   - ***** pelvic radiation in setting of stage IV lung cancer, which is likely to be more life-limiting than prostate cancer  - Trend PSA     #Supportive care  COVID - s/p Moderna x2 and then booster dose in 05/18/2021; would recommend 2nd booster if not already done   Flu vaccine 06/21/2021  Now on supplemental oxygen      RTC as needed in the future after scans or decision points in his care; tentatively plan in 2 months or so after next scans     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, \"\n"},

Path: squamous cell carcinoma, TTF-1 (+), ***** (+). *****-L1 5%                 Strata NGS: ***** *****. Note that tumor sample content less than the overall limit of detection, TMB/microsatellite status could not be determined  -04/07/2021 PET/CT: FDG avid right bronchial mass, right LN conglomerate measuring 4 cm, mediastinal LNs (largest 1.6 cm subcarinal) as well as pleural deposits and a L acetabular lytic lesion.   -04/08/2021-04/11/2021: Readmitted with hemoptysis that self resolved   -04/09/2021 CT angiogram: No PE. Right hilar mass corresponding to known right mainstem squamous cell carcinoma has increased slightly in \"\nsize. Cavitary lesion of the superior segment of the RLL has also increased slightly in size. Enlarged mediastinal adenopathy again seen.   -04/14/2021: C1 carboplatin/paclitaxel  -05/03/2021 MRI brain: no definite metastatic lesions, but tiny curvilinear area of enhancement within the left cerebellar hemisphere that could represent tiny developmental venous anomaly but too small to fully characterize.

No additional radiotracer avid osseous metastatic lesions.                -08/20/2021 CT chest: Interval progression of disease. The right hilar mass with airway invasion has progressed since 07/08/2021 and a subcarinal lymph node is also increased in size. Cavitary lesion in the right lower \"\nlobe, likely metastasis, has worsened. New hemorrhage in the right middle lobe corresponds to provided history of hemoptysis.       -08/24/2021 ***** thoracic tumor board: Progression, recommend radiation to left acetabulum and growing R hilar mass +/- RLL cavitary lesion. Consider changing treatment to sotorasib.   -09/01/2021: UCSF thoracic tumor board discussion. Agree with plan for radiation to right hilar mass +/- right acetabulum. If there is a delay in starting radiation, we would consider interventional pulm referral for bronchoscopy/ablation to help with bleeding. Agree with switching systemic treatment to sotorasib.     Prostate cancer:  Diagnosed in 2019 with GS 4+3 prostate cancer, baseline PSA 6.9, treated with lupron/casodex followed by radical prostatectomy on November 2020, path T2N0. He was noted to have a biochemical recurrence in February 2021 with PSA 0.2 with initial plan for radiation, but ultimately no longer recommended after lung cancer diagnosis.       INTERVAL HISTORY:  08/21/2021 MRI brain: No metastatic involvement. Moderate diffuse volume loss. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  Previously subacute small left cerebellar infarct has evolved, now with more chronic appearance.   -09/05/2021-09/28/2021: Presented to ER locally with shortness of breath, ultimately admitted for urgent treatment.   -09/07/2021 CT chest: Interval progression of disease of the known malignant right hilar mass with worsening airway invasion since 08/20/2021 as evidenced by complete right lung opacification with rightward mediastinal shift. This represents a combination of known malignancy, small right pleural effusion and diffuse right lung atelectasis and/or pneumonia causing right lung collapse. Prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also larger.   09/09/2021: Bronchoscopy with tumor destruction, debridement of RMB endobronchial lesion   Path: squamous cell carcinoma, moderate to poorly differentiated \"\n  -09/13/2021-09/27/2021: palliative radiation to right lung, 3,000 cGy in 10 fx  -10/01/2020: started sotorasib     - Mr. ***** is here today alone for follow up.   - Overall, his health has taken a significant turn for the worse over the last 5 weeks since his last appointment with me.  - Recent hospitalization and progression of his cancer has taken a lot out of him physically.

He is s/p 4 cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel (last 2 concurrent with pembrolizumab). Restaging scans after chemo showed a partial response with decreased size of RLL cavitary mass and right hilar lymphadenopathy, grossly stable size of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. He was then transitioned to ***** maintenance and has completed 3 cycles. Unfortunately, he has developed recurrent symptoms of hemoptysis and CT angiogram in 08/18/2021 showed progression with increased size of right hilar mass with airway invasion, increased size of a subcarinal lymph node and increased RLL cavitary mass (along with new hemorrhage in the RML). Bone scan also shows a new right iliac bone metastasis.  Here for a second opinion, primary treatment at ***** in ***** *****.     Admitted locally on 09/05/2021 for worsened dyspnea. Repeat imaging showed ongoing cancer progression in right hilar mass with now complete right lung opacification and rightward mediastinal shift. He underwent bronchoscopy on 09/09/2021 locally with endoscopic tumor ablation and is s/p a course of palliative RT to the right hilum, completed on 09/27/2021. He was just started on sotorasib as \"\nsystemic therapy as well on 10/01/2021.

No cord compression or cord signal abnormality. Associated anterior and posterior subligamentous soft tissue enhancement as well as abnormal enhancement within the posterior aspect of the adjacent T1, T2, and T4 vertebral bodies. Differential considerations include metastatic disease versus atypical infection such as tuberculosis. Consider further evaluation with PET/CT as well as CT-guided biopsy.  -09/11/21 PET/CT: Mildly hypermetabolic nodule along the right middle lobe is concerning for primary lung malignancy, with avid mediastinal nodes concerning for nodal involvement. Foci of osseous hypermetabolism in the right iliac spine and left femur are concerning for osseous metastasis. In light of this, wedge compression deformity with hypermetabolism is also concerning for a pathologic fracture although technically indeterminate as associated hypermetabolism may be reactive.   -10/08/21 CT bone biopsy:   -Path: metastatic carcinoma of lung primary   -QNS for \"\n*****, PD-L1  -10/19/21 Radiation oncology evaluation: Recommend palliative RT 20Gy in 5fx for T2-T4 spine, consider local consolidative RT depending on response to systemic therapy   -10/30/21 EBUS with Dr. *****   -Path: Station 7 node: metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, positive for *****, napsin-A, P40 (rare positive cells). ***** and  Napsin-A positivity is consistent with an adenocarcinoma from lung primary site.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with history of smoking and stage IV NSCLC (bone; ***** *****, PD-L1 5%), here for follow-up    #Stage IV NSCLC, ***** *****: PD-L1 5%. Status post first-line chemoimmunotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-407) given the possible squamous component (rare focal ***** positivity) on 11/28/21. Initial dose reduction for carbo from ***** 6 to 5 given advanced age and potential decreased reserve if he experiences a treatment complication. 05/14/2022 with increase in respiratory symptoms, CTPE with increased R pleural effusion, status post 05/16/2022 thoracentesis with pleural fluid demonstrating metastatic carcinoma. Clinical picture consistent with PD to 1L pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel. Then started 2L sotorasib 05/29/22 with dose hold/reduction due to LFTs; then 07/22/22 CT Chest with \"new diffuse multifocal geographic areas of groundglass opacity concerning for drug reaction versus viral infection\", then held 07/23/22 given potential for drug-induced pneumonitis. 07/24/22 with substantial increase in dyspnea and O2 requirement. Per report, increased sanguinous drainage from *****. Concern for respiratory compromise related to infection versus drug-induced pneumonitis, pleural effusion, and/or cancer progression. Consider other differential diagnosis (e.g. pulmonary embolism) as appropriate.  - Sotorasib was held 07/23/22; continue to hold  - Referred to UCSF ER for evaluation with likely plan to admit to Medicine  - Consider Pulmonary consultation and workup/treatment for infection and/or drug-induced \"\npneumonitis as appropriate  - Consider IR and/or other consultation for evaluation and management of chest PleurX and pleural effusion   - We held a serious illness conversation including the option to pursue less intensive approaches to care and/or consider best supportive care/hospice in the near future or at this time. The patient unequivocally elected to continue with standard management of acute medical issues and to consider future lines of systemic therapy if possible. ***** also follow-up with Dr. ***** (UCSF Symptom Management Service).   - Positive anti-HBc Ab; 04/24/22 LFTs within reference range. 05/24/22 HBV DNA undetectable  - Previously advised against herbs/supplements  - Follow-up with multidisciplinary team for pain and symptom management.     #Bone mets: S/p T3 kyphoplasty and RT to T2-T4 spine.   - Continue to hold zoledronic acid. Continue vit D + calcium supplementation along with current multivitamin. Again discussed rationale (e.g. ONJ risk). Follow-up subsequent dental records; visit with Univ of ***** scheduled in May 2022 missed due to thoracentesis.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma involving bone and possibly liver, ***** *****, PD-L1 80%, s/p radiation to spine and rib, s/p carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab x 3 with response, then decided to do go to ***** single agent, s/p 2 cycles, with progression, switched to sotorasib here for follow up.    # Stage IV adenocarcinoma. He was found to have ***** ***** mutation driving his tumor, which has a targeted therapy available but in the 2nd line. He ***** carboplatin, pemetrexed, and ***** (rather than ***** single agent given extensive disease burden) and also had radiation to spine and rib. Restaging scans after C2 showed clear improvement in chest but some bones were with increase in size and invasion, including C3 with further loss of ventral height and some apparent increase in hepatic tumors as well. He was evaluated in the ED and surgical decompression recommended though not urgently. Then we reviewed PET/CT after C3, requested to evaluate possible mixed response, and this was actually reassuring compared to 03/17/22, with clear pulmonary and nodal improvement, hepatic lesions NOT avid, and overall LESS avidity in bones, even though some lytic lesions had increased in size.    We then elected given good response but poor chemo tolerability to proceed with ***** alone esp given high PD-L1. However, imaging after 2 cycles on ***** alone, he had progression in liver and adrenal glands as well as thoracic lung \"\nand nodal disease.    We previously had a long discussion today about options in light of progression with options as follows:  --***** inhibitors as SOC 2nd line, sotorasib vs adagrasib-- no head to head data, either reasonable, adagrasib with more CNS benefit on data presented to date, but more tox  --add ***** +/- carbo back since PD is only after d/c-- but discussed tox issues when was on 3 drug combo, acknowledging also with bone pain at that time since resolved and at that time recently s/p rads with its own tox profile    After the visit he elected sotorasib and started.     Wife and pt recently noticed mass on right upper abdomen which wife circled, advised pt to come inperson to eval but declined. Mass decreased in size over night, no pain at site, no redness. Able to move bowels. Since he has scans scheduled next week will CTM for now. Pt/wife given ED precautions. If he develops pain, growth in mass etc will move imaging up sooner. PT agrees with plan.     Plan close imaging at 4 weeks, with PET/CT scheduled end of July.     # Bone metastatic disease: Extensive osseous involvement on PET. S/p radiation by Dr. *****. He is on zoledronic acid. Plan q3-4w tx x 1 year, then quarterly.     # Unstable C2 lesions. N/s recommends surgery, pt undecided but leaning against mostly out of concern for lengthy rehab.    # Supportive care.

Noted progressive R arm pain with lifting- more pronounced when came back from a trip in February, but prompted CT scan. Also had noted some increasing wheezing over this time.  -03/06/22 CT chest: CT chest with findings of metastatic cancer suspicious for metastatic lung cancer. Posterior right upper lobe lung mass measuring up to approximately 5.6 cm with broad contact with the pleural surface. Extensive lymphadenopathy in the right hilum, bilateral mediastinum, and bilateral lower neck. Pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases.

Multiple right-sided pulmonary nodules, extensive multistation thoracic lymphadenopathy, and multifocal osseous lesions with associated hypermetabolism, consistent with pulmonary, nodal, and osseous metastases. Associated pathologic fracture of the C3 vertebral body. Additionally, soft tissue component associated with the L5 vertebral body lesion partially extends into the spinal canal. Total spine MRI is recommended for further evaluation. Focus of hypermetabolism in the left hepatic lobe without clear CT correlate.  -03/17/22 MRI Brain: No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. ***** abnormality involving the C3 vertebral body with adjacent prevertebral soft tissue swelling, most compatible with osseous metastatic disease. No evidence of cord compression or significant osseous \"\nretropulsion.   -03/19/22 MRI Spine: Multilevel diffuse osseous metastases throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Mild loss of vertebral body height at C3. At L5, there is a component of epidural disease contributing to moderate canal stenosis. No evidence of leptomeningeal disease. Multilevel degenerative changes, without severe canal stenosis.

He was found to have ***** ***** mutation driving his tumor, which has a targeted therapy available but in the 2nd line. He ***** carboplatin, pemetrexed, and ***** (rather than ***** single agent given extensive disease burden) and also had radiation to spine and rib. Restaging scans after C2 showed clear improvement in chest but some bones were with increase in size and invasion, including C3 with further loss of ventral height and some apparent increase in hepatic tumors as well. He was evaluated in the ED and surgical decompression recommended though not urgently. Then we reviewed PET/CT after C3, requested to evaluate possible mixed response, and this was actually reassuring compared to 03/17/22, with clear pulmonary and nodal improvement, hepatic lesions NOT avid, and overall LESS avidity in bones, even though some lytic lesions had increased in size. We then elected given good response but poor chemo tolerability to proceed with ***** alone esp given high PD-L1. However, imaging after 2 cycles on ***** alone, he had progression in liver and adrenal glands as well as thoracic lung and nodal disease.    We then started on sotorasib 07/15/22. Initial PET/CT 08/14/22 on sotorasib showed response in thoracic disease (lung and mediastinum), liver, and adrenal. Most of his bony disease is stable to slightly increased, though there are a couple of sites that are more avid but without CT changed. On balance, this supports staying on sotorasib, and I recommended next scans with PET in 6-8 weeks, PET to cont to \"\nhelp clarify bony disease status given extensive extent.    In the interim he has had marked fatigue and episodes of AMS especially overnight. He has also had some urinary incontinence. He had CPMC admission with extensive workup that was unrevealing, notably including MRI spine without LMD which was a concern.    We decided to hold sotorasib for a couple of days, and today will restart at February 16 dose.    For component of anemia, he is now on Aranesp and I started iron this week-- will require another dose next week.    # Bone metastatic disease: Extensive osseous involvement on PET.

Multiple right-sided pulmonary nodules, extensive multistation thoracic lymphadenopathy, and multifocal osseous lesions with associated hypermetabolism, consistent with pulmonary, nodal, and osseous metastases. Associated pathologic fracture of the C3 vertebral body. Additionally, soft tissue component associated with the L5 vertebral body lesion partially extends into the spinal canal. Total spine MRI is recommended for further evaluation. Focus of hypermetabolism in the left hepatic lobe without clear CT correlate.  -03/17/22 MRI Brain: No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. ***** abnormality involving the C3 vertebral body with adjacent prevertebral soft tissue swelling, most compatible with osseous metastatic disease. No evidence of cord compression or significant osseous retropulsion.   -03/19/22 MRI Spine: Multilevel diffuse osseous metastases throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Mild loss of vertebral body height at C3. At L5, there is a component of epidural disease contributing to moderate canal stenosis. No evidence of leptomeningeal disease.

Band like density/scarring in the medial right upper lung again noted.   -03/11/2021 PET/CT: Findings compatible with severe and worsening multifocal pneumonia, most severely manifested in the left lower lobe. The masslike consolidation of concern has increased in size although has relatively reduced radiotracer uptake compared to other inflammatory changes in the lungs. This is therefore favored to represent airway plugging and airspace collapse. Recommend follow-up posttreatment CT in 6-8 weeks to reassess and continued imaging to resolution. Right upper lobectomy without convincing visible evidence of recurrent FDG-avid tumor.   -April 2021: Bronch locally, reportedly negative  -06/05/2021 \"\nthereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses.

Appointment the second week of June.   She will move forward with RT to L arm locally in the meantime, continue sotorasib     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained \"\ninformed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.      \"\nCT chest: Interval enlargement of the left lower lobe dense consolidation/mass superimposed on diffuse groundglass and nodular consolidative opacities suspicious for recurrent lung cancer. By report patient is scheduled for bronchoscopy and/or FNA for definitive diagnosis. Scattered additional new areas of groundglass opacity within the left upper lobe and posterior and central right lung. Single area of peripheral mid right lung. Irregular consolidative opacity. Differential possibilities include multifocal pneumonia or metastatic lung cancer. No metastatic adenopathy or other significant interval change.   -May 262021 Bronch                   Cytology: benign, no atypia or malignancy identified, BAL with acute inflammatory cells, negative GMS staining for pneumocystis and fungal organisms.   -May 2021: new oxygen requirement   -07/21/2021 CT chest: Worsening of findings compatible with bilateral recurrent invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma.

Specimen ***** adequate, pulmonary macrophages absent  -08/25/2021 Thoracic tumor board: repeat PET, consider LLL biopsy  -09/23/2021 PET/CT: Probable chronic, evolving post-surgical/post-therapeutic within the right apical/upper lung and right hilum. Very extensive/diffuse patchy/hazy opacities elsewhere throughout the lung fields bilaterally that are progressive in extent from the patient's prior PET/CT, as detailed above.  There are particularly dense/confluent, more significantly hypermetabolic opacities throughout the left lower pulmonary lobe and lingula that have progressed in extent from the patient's prior PET/CT (though they demonstrate mixed changes in metabolism).  A widely disseminated, evolving/progressing infectious/inflammatory process is strongly suspected, though a pulmonary malignancy or superimposed malignancy (potentially with surrounding lymphangitic or \"\ninfiltrative tumor spread) cannot be entirely excluded. There are underlying mild pulmonary emphysematous changes, as well as a few small (subcentimeter) lung nodules that are too small to definitively characterize. Other likely-benign findings (as detailed above), with no specific metabolic evidence of malignant or metastatic disease outside of the lungs.    -09/26/2021-10/02/2021: Admitted to UCSF with hypoxia and shortness of breath and underwent expedited work up. Treated with parainfluenza and discharged with higher NC oxygen (4L at rest, up to 6L with activity)   -09/25/2021 CT chest: No acute pulmonary embolism to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. Compared to 07/21/2021, interval increase in bilateral groundglass opacities and interlobular septal thickening as well as masslike consolidation, particularly in the left greater than right lower lobes. Given the patient's history of malignancy, these findings are concerning for worsening bilateral invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma.   -09/29/2021 CT-guided left lower lobe lung biopsy                  Path: pulmonary adenocarcinoma                  IHC: CK7+, ***** negative, TTF-1+, Napsin-A+, P40 negative, CD68 negative, ***** negative                  ***** ***** *****, *****, ***** mutations.

The palms of her hands got red and itchy. She got benadryl which fixed it.  -12/16/2021: recurrent diarrhea, testing for C diff resent.  -12/23/2021 PET/CT: There is higher uptake in the more consolidated areas of the extensive patchy opacities in the left lower lung compared to the prior scan, of uncertain significance. There is no \"\nsignificant change in the size of the anterior left lung base consolidation and there is a new posterolateral left lower lung consolidation within the extensive patchy opacities in the left lower lobe. There is improvement of the extensive diffuse, patchy opacities in the right lung post upper lobectomy and left upper lobe to the lingula, which may be a response to therapy.   -late January 2022: single dose of pemetrexed due to concerns about carboplatin reaction   -02/22/2022 CT chest: Extensive bilateral infiltrates in both lungs have significantly progressed in the interval, L>R and probably related to pneumonitis or a component of an infectious process. ***** mass in ***** overall mildly improved in the interval. Assessment for smaller tumor foci in both lungs is significantly hampered by extensive bilateral airspace disease. No adenopathy. Small nonspecific pericardial effusion.   -March 17?/2022: C3 carboplatin/pemetrexed (split into two days)   -04/07/2022: C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed   -04/27/2022 PET/CT: Multiple new hypermetabolic bone lesions consistent with bone metastases. Masslike consolidation in the LLL appears similar to 02/22/2022. Extensive bilateral groundglass airspace disease has mildly improved since that time. FDG avidity in the LLL has significantly improved since 12/22/2021.   -06/28/2022 - CT CAP - Left lower lobe mass with surrounding groundglass and interstitial changes unchanged. There is a new peripheral masslike density in the right middle lobe as well also with surrounding groundglass and interstitial change. Stable osseous metastatic lesion. Increasing biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation of indeterminate significance.

Posttreatment changes in the \"\nright lung apex, interval improvement in the consolidative opacity in the left lower lobe with a 4.2 x 2.1 cm lobular density in the left infrahilar region, the left lower lobe, possible residual malignancy versus metastatic disease cannot be excluded. Further evaluation with PET CT scan can be performed. Development of sclerotic lesions in the sternum and T4 vertebral body, left seventh rib, likely representing metastatic disease.   -12/06/2022 PET/CT: There has been a slight progression of metastatic disease in the bone and soft tissue as above. There is limited evaluation of brain and breasts.     INTERVAL HISTORY:  -02/23/2023 PET/CT: Persistent but with some metabolic reduction of the metastatic disease in the bone and soft tissue as above.

Imaging result in interval history above.   Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)                 02/23/23 0000  PETCT Limited Whole Body Vertex to Mid Thigh (Storage Only) Final result    Narrative:  This is a study performed outside UCSF and stored for the purposes of    comparison as requested by  Not In System Radiology Provider.                  Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with remote history of a RUL lung adenocarcinoma, treated initially back in 2009 for a ***** cancer with ***** with cisplatin/pemetrexed then downstaged to T2N0 and taken to surgery. Then many years late developed with increasing bilateral consolidations and diffuse groundglass, worst in the LLL, s/p several negative biopsies but ultimately found to have biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Pathological \"\ndiagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her recent lung biopsy here at *****. It took several procedures to come up with the diagnosis, but finally CT-guided biopsy did confirm cancer. I suspect this is a separate primary than her original lung cancer back in 2009. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma was suspected based on radiographic appearance, the path here is consistent with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ***** showed a ***** ***** mutation and PD-L1 was 0%.      Based on bilateral lung involvement on PET/CT and CT scans, the patient appears to have stage ***** disease. No clear distant metastatic disease outside of the thorax, however. We discussed the fact that stage ***** disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.      I previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. ***** ***** is an actionable mutation, with sotorasib and adagrasib approved as targeted therapy albeit technically approved in the 2L after chemotherapy +/- *****. Therefore, we started with carboplatin/pemetrexed alone (held off on immunotherapy initially given her recent infectious complications, deconditioning, and initially borderline performance status). She tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well overall in terms of symptoms and energy. Restaging scans on 12/22/2021 show some areas of improvement/resolution (right lung and *****) but with persistent patchy consolidation in *****, some areas decreased and others potentially increased but confounded by post-obstructive changes. Also important to note that a month and a half elapsed from prior pre-treatment scan in September and when she actually started treatment in November. Therefore in the absence of clear evidence of progression we planned to continue. However there was initially some delay due to recurrent Cdiff+ and diarrhea, and then there \"\nwas concern about a carboplatin reaction. She received one cycle of pemetrexed alone and then two additional cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. Restaging PET/CT scans on 04/27/2022; hard to say based on non-diagnostic CT scan the extent of progression. The bone findings do have CT correlates and do appear new. There has been improvement in ***** findings, possibly more uptake in consolidative LLL mass-like lesion, but hard to tell extent of progression without a diagnostic scan.     There was reasonable concern for some progression given the new hypermetabolic bone metastases, and possibly some progression in the left lung. Ultimately she preferred  ***** therapy SoC over our ***** 101 clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy, started sotorasib in 06/27/2022. She tolerated tx very well so far. Only side effect is easy bruising. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 showed slight interval progression in the bones and a single soft tissue lesion--but it's fairly subtle. Overall she feels great still, improved compared to last 6-12 months. Today, we reviewed PET/CT from 02/23/2023 which shows improvement in bone and soft tissue disease consistent with ongoing response to sotorasib. She does have pain in L arm which corresponds to site of L acetabular bone metastasis; I am supportive of palliative RT to this area to treat pain. I would continue sotorasib for now, plan repeat restaging scans in about 12 weeks, or earlier as needed for new symptoms.   At that time of progression, she has never had a checkpoint inhibitor, so I would favor an immunotherapy-based approach as next line treatment - either pembrolizumab alone or potentially ***** + docetaxel as per the PROLONG study (***** et al., 2020).     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Suspect stage ***** disease given bilateral lung involvement on scans. ***** NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 0%. Very symptomatic at diagnosis, requiring 4L supplemental oxygen. And then was \"\nsignificantly deconditioned with ECOG PS 3 following several hospitalizations for cdiff/PNA/sepsis and associated bedrest. Fortunately she improved significantly with treatment of her infections and the initiation of chemotherapy. ECOG PS subsequently improved to ~1. Her April 2022 scans were concerning for progressive disease in the bones, and possibly also in the left lung s/p C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed. She was subsequently switched to sotorasib. Scans in 08/21/22 demonstrated partial response. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 with interval PD in the bones and one soft tissue lesion, but subtle. PET/CT from 02/23/2023 stable to improved overall. She continues to feel great overall, better than before. So we will continue sotorasib for now and plan interval scans in 3 months. At the time of progression would consider immunotherapy-based treatment (e.g. *****, alone or possibly with docetaxel).     - Continue Sotorasib 960 mg/day for now given significant and ongoing clinical improvement   - PET/CT from 08/21/22 with reported partial response, particularly with mass-like LLL consolidation smaller and less PET avid  - PET from 12/06/2022 shows some early progression in the bones; but she continues to feel great, better than on prior chemo regimen so discussed continuing a bit longer and getting a short interval PET in 2 months   - PET/CT from 02/23/2023 stable to improved   - Continue sotorasib for now  - Next scans in 12 weeks  - palliative RT to painful L acetabular met would be very reasonable for pain palliation, this can be done locally   - Recommendations discussed with Dr. *****  - At time of more significant progression, consider ***** +/- docetaxel     #Bone metastases  We discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo \"\n"},

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  -August 2021 Patient presented with back pain.   -08/27/21 CT chest (CPMC): 1.3 x 3.5 cm spiculated bilobed nodule at the right middle lobe. Patchy sclerosis and rarefaction at T3 along with height loss at endplates. No significant vertebral body retropulsion or obvious epidural mass.   -09/04/2021 Consultation with Dr. *****. EBUS/biopsy was scheduled but patient tested COVID+ on 09/12/2021 (incidental positive on pre-procedure screening test) and procedure was cancelled. Planned for further imaging and biopsy of one of the peripheral bone lesions.   -09/07/21 MRI brain: neg  -09/08/21 MRI T spine: T3 pathologic fracture with approximately 50% height loss and associated mild posterior retropulsion into the spinal canal without significant spinal canal stenosis. No cord compression or cord signal abnormality. Associated anterior and posterior subligamentous soft tissue enhancement as well as abnormal enhancement within the posterior aspect of the adjacent T1, T2, and T4 vertebral bodies. Differential considerations include metastatic disease versus atypical infection such as tuberculosis. Consider further evaluation with \"\nPET/CT as well as CT-guided biopsy.  -09/11/21 PET/CT: Mildly hypermetabolic nodule along the right middle lobe is concerning for primary lung malignancy, with avid mediastinal nodes concerning for nodal involvement. Foci of osseous hypermetabolism in the right iliac spine and left femur are concerning for osseous metastasis. In light of this, wedge compression deformity with hypermetabolism is also concerning for a pathologic fracture although technically indeterminate as associated hypermetabolism may be reactive.   -10/08/21 CT bone biopsy:   -Path: metastatic carcinoma of lung primary   -QNS for *****, PD-L1  -10/19/21 Radiation oncology evaluation: Recommend palliative RT 20Gy in 5fx for T2-T4 spine, consider local consolidative RT depending on response to systemic therapy     INTERVAL HISTORY:  -10/30/21 EBUS with Dr. *****   -Path: Station 7 node: metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, positive for *****, napsin-A, P40 (rare positive cells). ***** and  Napsin-A positivity is consistent with an adenocarcinoma from lung primary site.

Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools. My location is in a UCSF clinical facility.       ID: ***** is a very pleasant ***** yo woman with hx of primary bronchogenic adenocarcinoma, stage IIIA diagnosed when she was admitted for pancreatitis in April 2020.    HPI: The patient has history of hypertension, anxiety, and SIADH, and presented to the emergency room on 05/13/20 with complaints of chest pain and upper abdominal pain. She did report consumption of nearly one bottle of wine per day although was trying to cut back due to the pain. She denied any cough or weight loss. She is a smoker and has used one pack per day for 30 years although at some point she was able to quit for 2 years but restarted smoking during COVID. She recently moved to ***** ***** from ***** ***** approximately one year ago, and she lives with her nephew. In the emergency room she had CT scan of chest abdomen and pelvis which showed a spiculated left upper lobe nodule suspicious for primary lung malignancy, and enlarged left hilar and AP window lymph nodes of 13 and 10 mm respectively. There were also some smaller nodules in both lungs which were nonspecific, as well as moderate emphysema, small pericardial effusion, bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and nodularity suspicious for metastatic disease but nonspecific. There were also coarse calcifications in the pancreas consistent with prior episodes of pancreatitis, ill-defined soft tissue infiltration between stomach and pancreas likely inflammatory, small \"\ndoes not have any visceral organ or bone involvement.  Brain MRI was negative.  Past treatment included 4 cycles of neoadjuvant *****/Alimta in September 2020 which was well tolerated. PET/CT scan at completion of chemo showed very good partial response.  She then underwent left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection at ***** by Dr ***** on 12/13/20. Pathology showed residual high grade 2.5 cm adenocarcinoma and 6 positive lymph nodes, without extracapsular extension, but there was lymphovascular invasion. She completed adjuvant radiation therapy to the mediastinum over 5 weeks, which was also very well tolerated, ending in March 2021. She then completed adjuvant Atezolizumab X 18 doses, last on 05/08/22.    Unfortunately she presented with metastatic disease to lymph nodes on imaging in July 2022. This was biopsy-proven from the left supraclavicular lymph node that shows adenocarcinoma of lung primary.  Lymphadenopathy was up to 2 cm in size, and bilateral cervical, left axillary, mediastinal, aortocaval and gastrohepatic regions. NGS panel from left SCL LN as well as from prior lung tissue showed ***** p.***** mutation.  Therefore ***** was started on sotorasib 960 mg daily and so far this is well tolerated. CBC and LFTs are normal.  She will cont with this dose and repeat labs every 3 weeks X 2 more times.  We will plan a CT C/A/P after she has been on sotorasib X 3 months, ie ***** of December 2022.    ***** has also met with Dr ***** and palliative care team. She was interested in learning more about the right to die at. She would like to have a plan for the future as she does not have a lot of support in this area; she lives in ***** ***** with strangers and does not want to end up in a nursing home.    # Hx pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation: pancreatitis is resolved and pancreatic tail cyst is now resolved. She is asymptomatic. She uses pancreatic enzymes with meals.    # Hx SIADH. This has been a chronic problem \"\nprior to her cancer diagnosis. She did have a recent hospitalization for severe hyponatremia and did establish care with nephrology. She is on NaCl tabs and has recently increase the dose to 2 tablets daily.    # Hx hypothyroidism, worsened with autoimmune thyroiditis: on synthroid, managed by Dr *****.    # *****: on Lipitor now, tolerating well.     # Follow-up: in 4 weeks, then again after the CT scan. She will eventually transition care to Dr ***** - we discussed this today.    # Emotional support: ***** is benefiting from participation the survivorship support group.           #  Pain  Pain assessment for this encounter  Pain Score/Location    10/09/22 0947   *****:  0     Pain management plan outlined below as of 10/11/22   n/a      Below for billing only         I spent a total of 30 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.                                   \"\namount of ascites, heterogeneous uterus, and suggestion of possible left adnexal mass versus colon configuration. Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe 2.4 cm masslike density. Abdominal ultrasound was consistent with pancreatitis and extensive pancreatic calcifications. She was admitted for treatment of pancreatitis.  During the admission, she underwent CT-guided biopsy of the left upper lobe lung mass. Pathology has come back as adenocarcinoma arising in association with a fibroid last 6 car. PD L1 DPS score was strong positive in 95%. Additional molecular markers were requested. I had recommended a PET scan to be done as outpatient and she is now returning to discuss that. In addition she had pelvic ultrasound on 05/14/20 prior to leaving the hospital which showed myomatous uterus but normal appearing ovaries bilaterally and no left adnexal mass detected.  She saw pulmonology, Dr *****, for EBUS and bx of the AP window lymph node - was not successful. After a discussion at our local tumor board, recs were made for referral to thoracic surgery to complete staging and evaluation for surgery. She saw Dr ***** ***** but also wanted to be seen by a thoracic surgeon specifically and was therefore referred to ***** ***** ***** at *****.    NGS testing showed ***** p.***** mutation in 3% of cells.    PAST THERAPY: s/p 4 cycles of neoadjuvant Carboplatin and Pemetrexed, C4D1 on 10/07/20.  12/13/20: S/p ***** lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node resection by Dr *****,  revealing 2.5cm residual tumor (40% viable), high grade, +LVI, negative margins, June 21 LNs involved (no *****), *****.  02/08/21-03/15/21: adjuvant XRT 5000 cGy in 25 fractions.  Atezolizumab q 21 days, started 04/21/2021, for total of 18 doses, last 05/08/22.    Unfortunately PET scan on 08/14/22 showed metastatic disease in mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  PET scan showed only involvement of the lymph nodes but no visceral organs (including 20 mm right \"\ncervical lymph node with SUV of 5.9, left supraclavicular 2.6 cm lymph node with SUV of 4.85, left 15 mm axillary lymph node with SUV of 6.6, 2.4 cm subcarinal lymph node with SUV of 2.79, 8 mm anterior mediastinal lymph node with SUV of 2.29, and then additional aortocaval, periaortic, and gastrohepatic adenopathy with SUV of 3.88).  Brain MRI showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  On 08/21/2022 she underwent ultrasound biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph node with pathology showing metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary.  PDL-L1 was 30%.    CURRENT THERAPY: Lumakras (Sotorasib) 960 mg daily started 09/17/22.         Interval history since last visit and relevant symptoms   I saw ***** ***** ***** ***** follow-up, after starting sotorasib 3 weeks ago. ***** reports feeling well and she has not noticed any side effects. She has good energy and has not had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or water retention. She denies any shortness of breath or cough. When there was smoke in the air recently, she felt heaviness in her chest, but it has now resolved. Her appetite is a bit lower but she is eating ok. She started taking 2 NaCl tabs per day when she saw Na 128 on recent labs. ***** met with Dr ***** and his team and had a good initial visit. She ha snot had any fevers or infections.  The rest of symptoms were reviewed and are negative.

Review of Prior Imaging: I \"\npersonally reviewed and interpreted each of the patient's relevant imaging studies in conjunction with the co ***** formal radiology reports, as outlined in my HPI/Oncologic History     08/14/22: PET scan  IMPRESSION:     1. Hypermetabolic metastatic lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, and abdomen, as detailed above.     2. Status post left upper lobectomy. Mild wedge-shaped soft tissue and/or fluid noted along the resection margin with associated mild hypermetabolism peripherally (SUV max 2.76, March 26:64), nonspecific.     3. Mild patchy interstitial and groundglass opacities noted throughout the left lower lobe with areas of associated mild hypermetabolism (SUV max 2.83); these findings are new compared to ***** chest 08/07/2022, and thus favored to be infectious/inflammatory in etiology.       08/12/22: MRI brain  IMPRESSION:     1. No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.     2. Mild burden of chronic white matter small vessel ischemic change.     08/07/22: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:     1. Compared to 02/13/2022 there is progression of metastatic disease with increased size and number of mediastinal, left subpectoral, retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy as described above.     2. Stable postsurgical changes status post left upper lobectomy without evidence of local disease recurrence.       04/22/22: CT brain non-con  IMPRESSION:     1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, herniation or hydrocephalus.     2. Chronic white matter small vessel ischemic change.     02/13/22: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:   1. Postop changes in the chest (left upper lobectomy) without evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Diminished left pleural fluid collection as above.   2. No infradiaphragmatic metastatic disease detected. Resolved pancreatic cyst; stable left adreniform fullness.     07/21/21: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:   1. Postop changes left upper lobectomy, stable loculated left anterior superior pleural fluid collection. \"\nTiny left posterior-inferior pleural effusion.   2. Shotty mediastinal/left hilar nodes.   3. Sequela of chronic pancreatitis with multiple calcifications + new approximately 14 mm nonenhancing pancreatic tail cyst.   4. Nonspecific mild dilation of few small bowel loops, correlate clinically.     04/04/21 CT C/A/P:  IMPRESSION:     1. Status post left upper lobectomy without evidence of residual parenchymal disease. Anterior left pleural thickening and small loculated effusion are likely post surgical in etiology.   2. Stable few shotty mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes which are not pathologically enlarged.   3. No definite evidence of metastatic disease in abdomen and pelvis.   4. Stable nodularity of the left greater than right adrenal glands, likely reflecting adenomatous change.   5. Chronic pancreatitis with resolution of a prior pancreatic tail cystic lesion/collection and near resolution of a small anterior peripancreatic fluid collection.       PET scan + CT chest w contrast 10/20/20:  IMPRESSION:   1. Spiculated left upper lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 18 x 13 mm with ***** SUV 4.3, mildly decreasing since last exam when it measured 22 x 13 mm with ***** SUV 6.7.   2. Mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy is also significantly decreasing since last exam in both size and metabolic activity, now basically not pathologically enlarged; highest metabolic activity in a nonenlarged left hilar node measuring max SUV 3.6 (previously 5.5 max SUV).   3. No definite metastatic disease in the abdomen pelvis   4. Stable bilateral nodular adrenal glands, presumably adenomatous change.   5. Unchanged pseudocyst between the pancreas and stomach, possibly new 14 mm pseudocyst in the tail the pancreas, with chronic pancreatitis.    PET scan 08/13/20:  IMPRESSION:   1. Revisualization of the hypermetabolic known left upper lobe lung cancer.   2. ***** left hilar adenopathy. Prevascular, low left paratracheal and AP window \"\nadenopathy.   3. ***** bilateral adrenal nodularity, left more than right, stable. The findings are not entirely specific but likely represent benign adenomatous change given the lack of ***** hypermetabolism.   4. Further interval slight enlargement of a ***** fluid collection interposed between the stomach and pancreas, possibly representing an enlarging, maturing pseudocyst. The lack of ***** hypermetabolism is reassuring.            Pathology   08/21/22: U/S guided FNA left SCL LN  FINAL MICROSCOPIC DIAGNOSIS:   Metastatic adenocarcinoma.

He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, Dr. ***** thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, it was decided to stop study treatment.      Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded very nicely. However complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. More recently he has been on a treatment break to let liver recover.      CT scans from *****/*****/***** for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, we continued his treatment break. Repeat restaging scans from *****/*****/***** previously reviewed. MRI brain unfortunately shows new multifocal brain metastases. CT c/a/p otherwise fairly stable. He is now s/p GK to a total of 21 \"\ntargets.     Given that his main site of progression is the CNS, highest utility will be an agent with CNS activity. Unfortunately he did not respond well to carboplatin/pemetrexed/*****-based approach in 1L, and other chemotherapy options (gemcitabine, docetaxel) will likely not have much activity in the brain and do not cross ***** barrier very well. Dr ***** previously also ***** ***** ***** whether a trial of adagrasib could be considered. He will be at high risk for hepatotoxicity with adagrasib as there is some thought that this is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors particularly after immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, adagrasib does have CNS activity and he never had progression while on ***** inhibitor so it has some advantages over his other treatment options. ***** preferred adagrasib trial. Started adagrasib 200 mg BID on *****/***** with weekly lab monitoring for LFTs. This is the lowest possible dose but *****-1 trial did have some patients at this dose who responded. Median time to onset of hepatotoxicity is 3 weeks so we should have a sense early on. We will also set up weekly provider visits to start and continue his weekly hydration appointments.    - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on *****/*****/*****. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib, most likely drug-induced liver injury *****/***** sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped \"\nindefinitely   - *****/*****/***** and *****/*****/***** CT C/A/P with stable systemic disease  - However MRI brain from *****/*****/***** showed multiple new brain mets. Now s/p GK to 21 targets.  - Discussed some options for treatment including chemo (q2 week gemcitabine but not necessarily with good CNS activity vs pemetrexed but he had PD on this before) versus a trial of adagrasib (but reasonable risk of hepatotoxicity)  - Ultimately he prefers *****. Started on lowest possible dose of adagrasib 200 mg BID, will need weekly labs for LFT monitoring to start and we will also arrange for weekly NP/MD provider visits as well to keep a very close eye on him. So far he is tolerating it well.   - Some concern that hepatotoxicity is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors, particularly after prior *****, discussed risks at length with him today and reviewed early signs/symptoms to watch for on treatment   - CT scans and brain MRI 6 weeks after starting therapy to assess initial response; MRI brain scheduled *****/*****/***** and CT c/a/p scheduled *****/*****/*****  - Continue weekly infusion center visits and labs  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider. Last option might be a ***** of pemetrexed monotherapy for CNS activity, although in the past he had minimal response to 2 cycles pemetrexed-based chemo.     No new complaints today. Continue with labs and hydration. Follow-up in one week.  ADDENDUM: Labs reviewed, stable.    #Pruritis  - Generalized, not new or worsening, not impacting sleep (baseline poor sleep quality).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  -05/01/2010 CT chest: Multiple calcified pulmonary nodules, biapical scarring, chronically impacted airways, and calcified mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes, most suggestive of old granulomatous disease.   -12/21/2017 CT chest: Compared to 2011, stable nodular biapical scarring in addition to calcified nodules seen elsewhere, compatible with prior granulomatous disease.   -04/01/2021 CT c/a/p to work up weight loss: Right upper lobe mass measuring up to 2.5 cm, concerning for malignancy. Clustered tree-in-bud nodules in the right lower lobe and scattered calcified biapical nodules, likely reflecting chronic infection or sequela thereof. ***** in a/p.   -05/05/2021 PET/CT: ***** hypermetabolic right upper lobe pulmonary nodule (2.7 x 2.6 cm) has mildly increased size compared to 04/01/2021 and is suspicious for primary pulmonary malignancy. Subcentimeter lytic lesions in the left posterolateral sixth rib, T8 vertebral body, and T10 vertebral body with hypermetabolism are indeterminate but raise suspicious for sites of metastatic disease given gradual enlargement since 2018. MRI of the thoracic spine could be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated. A high attenuation 1.1 cm lesion in the region of the third ventricle without hypermetabolism may represent a \"\nobtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.        \"\ncolloid cyst but is incompletely evaluated.   -05/06/2021 PFTs: FEV1 88% pred, DLCO 65% predicted  -05/15/2021 CT-guided biopsy of RUL lung mass                 Path: pulmonary adenocarcinoma                 IHC: *****+, Napsin *****+, ***** neg.                  *****: *****, ***** *****, *****, ***** mutations.

No changes to dose due to 3.5 kg weight loss and profound feeling over being overwhelmed. Added fosaprepitant for CINV.   -08/07/2021 DVT ultrasound. Acute DVT in bilateral gastrocnemius veins. Started rivaroxaban.   -08/20/2021 CT c/a/p: Compared to 05/05/2021, increased burden of metastatic disease in the chest as evidenced by increased size of masslike consolidation in the right upper lobe, newly enlarged 1.6 cm subcarinal lymph node, increased size of multiple lytic lesions in the spine and ribs as well as a a few new lytic osseous lesions. Of note, there is a small amount of osseous destruction along the posterior aspect of the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies without definite evidence of spinal canal invasion, however recommend correlation with neurologic exam. A slowly enlarging 1.7 cm cystic lesion in the left upper lobe is suspicious metachronous adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesion. Compared to 05/05/2021, new bandlike soft tissue measuring approximately 4.4 x 1.0 cm extending along the left mesorectum to the presacral region and obliterating the fat plane with the left seminal vesicle. This would be an unusual appearance for metastasis, but \"\ntumor involvement is a consideration. If clinically warranted MR pelvis with contrast can be obtained.   -09/01/2021: Consented for ***** clinical trial  -09/08/2021 MRI brain: *****, stable 8 mm colloid cyst of the 3rd ventricle   -09/09/2021 CT c/a/p: Compared to 08/20/2021, unchanged burden of metastatic disease in the chest unchanged dominant right upper lobe lesion and similar appearance of osseous lesions in the spine and ribs. On the prior study dated 08/20/2021 new band like soft tissue was identified along the left mesorectum and extending to the presacral region and abutting the left seminal vesicle. This appearance is again identified with marked enhancement of the second tissue on this contrast-enhanced study. The appearance is more inflammatory than neoplastic. However the origin of the inflammation is not clearly identified. There is no definite communication to the rectum or evidence of fistula or diverticulitis.

However complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. More recently he has been on a treatment break to let liver recover.      CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, we continued his treatment break. Repeat restaging scans from 05/19/2022 previously reviewed. MRI brain unfortunately shows new multifocal brain metastases. CT c/a/p otherwise fairly stable. He is now s/p GK to a total of 21 targets. Now here for follow up.     Given that his main site of progression is the CNS, highest utility will be an agent with CNS activity. Unfortunately he did not respond well to carboplatin/pemetrexed/*****-based approach in 1L, and other chemotherapy options (gemcitabine, docetaxel) will likely not have much activity in the brain and do not cross ***** barrier very well. I also ***** ***** ***** whether a trial of adagrasib could be considered. He will be at high risk for hepatotoxicity with adagrasib as there is some thought that this is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors particularly after immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, adagrasib does have CNS activity and he never had progression while on ***** inhibitor so it has some advantages over his other treatment options. I discussed options with ***** at length today and his preference is for adagrasib trial. Started adagrasib 200 mg BID on June 22 with weekly lab monitoring for LFTs. This is the lowest possible dose but *****-1 \"\ntrial did have some patients at this dose who responded. Median time to onset of hepatotoxicity is 3 weeks so we should have a sense early on. We will also set up weekly provider visits to start and continue his weekly hydration appointments. Counseled at lengths about risks and he agrees to proceed.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with stable systemic disease  - However MRI brain from 05/19/2022 showed multiple new brain mets. Now s/p GK to 21 targets.  - Discussed some options for treatment including chemo (q2 week gemcitabine but not necessarily with good CNS activity vs pemetrexed but he had PD on this before) versus a trial of adagrasib (but reasonable risk of hepatotoxicity)  - Ultimately he prefers *****. Started on lowest possible dose of adagrasib 200 mg BID, will need weekly labs for LFT monitoring to start and we will also arrange for weekly NP/MD provider visits as well to keep a very close eye on him. Labs normal today, will CTM.    - Some concern that hepatotoxicity is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors, particularly after prior *****, discussed risks at length with him today and reviewed early signs/symptoms to watch for on treatment   - CT \"\nscans and brain MRI 6 weeks after starting therapy to assess initial response   - Continue weekly infusion center visits and labs  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider. Last option might be a ***** of pemetrexed monotherapy for CNS activity, although in the past he had minimal response to 2 cycles pemetrexed-based chemo.     #Brain mets  S/p GK to 21 targets on 06/02/2022. Given number of new lesions, I think a CNS active agent will be key and this contributed to our decision to move forward with adagrasib despite liver risks.     #Anemia  -Additional dose of feraheme given on June 11  -Hemoglobin improved now to 10.6   -He declines blood transfusions for religious reasons     #Constipation  -Continue colace/senna       Advance care planning  This patient has named a surrogate decision maker.

History of Present Illness:  ***** is a ***** years old male with hx of moderate alcohol use, fatty liver disease, who diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma on 05/15/2021 with evidence of metastasis to bone s/p chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Patient is referred to hepatology clinic for worsening of LFT. He was first seen in hepatology clinic on 12/01/2021. This is a follow up visit.     He has history of chronic mild LFT elevation. The LFT in 2012 was mildly elevated with ***** 105, ALT 47, AST 89 with normal bilirubin. The LFT show some fluctuations in ***** ranging between 40-80 and ***** *****-***** with normal bilirubin. The etiology of elevated LFT was attributed to moderate to heavy alcohol use. The viral hepatitis were unremarkable except history of exposure to hepatitis B with core Ab positivity.  Liver imaging persistently showing increased echogenicity and hepatomegaly.    On 05/15/2021, he was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma confirmed by CT guided biopsy. There was also evidence of lytic lesion in ***** bodies c/w metastasis to bone. No evidence of metastasis to intra-abdominal organs, or to the brain. He was started on carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab on 07/16/2021. Further imaging showed progression of disease and increased in burden of metastasis. The treatment has stopped and he was consented for clinical trial using sotorasib and docetaxel. Patient decided to stop study treatment on 10/02/2021. He was started on only-sotorasib on 10/09/2021.     He did not show any change in ***** after initial round of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pembrolizumab. LFT on 08/05/2021 was T bili 0.3, Alk phos 142, AST 19, ALT 7. After short period of clinical trial treatment with Sotorasib and docetaxel on September 30-October 03, he started on Sotorasib monotherapy on 10/09/2021. The \"\nhistory of primary ***** adenocarcinoma, fatty liver disease in setting of moderate alcohol use started on sotorasib who developed transaminitis likely due to *****.    Abnormal liver tests due to *****: He showed significant acute liver injury with total bilirubin rising more than 30 in setting of resumption of *****. Liver biopsy from 01/29/22 showed hepatitis with multifocal bile duct injury. Abdominal imaging did not show any obstructive lesions. Given the temporal association of ***** ***** and improvement of LFT after stopping *****, the source of acute liver injury is most likely is ***** from *****.     We recommend to avoid ***** given the high risk of liver injury. It seems the liver injury is progressively improving. LFT can be monitored on monthly basis until normalized. The decision to start another type of immunotherapy is deferred to oncology team and based on goals of care discussions.     Hepatitis B exposure, He has core ab positive and negative surf Ag consistent with hepatitis B exposure. He has no evidence of cirrhosis. HBV recently rechecked which was negative. It would be reasonable to continue empiric Hep B prophylaxis with entecavir.       Fatty changes of liver, He has chronic fatty changes of liver along with mild LFT elevation prior to recent rise in *****. Given the normal work up including autoimmune, viral and ***** and absence of risk factors for NAFLD, the most likely source of fatty change of liver is moderate alcohol use. Patient stopped drinking alcohol and is maintaining sobriety for at least 6 months. Patient counseled to maintain sobriety.    GB polyp, He has gallbladder poly of 1.8 cm based on the most recent US, but given the presence of metastatic disease, further surveillance is not indicated.     Hypoenhancing liver lesions, He has multiple small hypoenhancing liver lesions consistent with hemangioma. The most recent CT scan did not show any change \"\nin features of hepatic lesions since 2013.     Vaccination: He is immune against hepatitis B and A.     I advised him to abstain from alcohol use.    Summary of recommendations  - Monitor LFT every 4 weeks until normalization  - Follow up in 3 months    ***** *****, MD  Transplant Hepatology Fellow, *****    Case was dicussed with Dr. *****        \"\nliver function test start to show significant change starting 11/16/2021 with rise in ***** up to 312, ALT 97, and AST 126. The LFT continued to rise with ***** 442, AST 257, and ALT 277.  Given the rise in *****, ***** put on hold on 11/27/2021.     Patient was evaluated in liver clinic and ***** was found as the most likely etiology of elevated LFT. After holding *****, the LFT on 12/04/2021 showed some improvement with ***** 315, ALT 146, AST 77. The LFT continues to improve with labs on 12/22/20212 as ***** 117, AST 19, ALT 26, and total ***** 0.4. ***** resumed at lower dose (half dose with 480 mg) on 12/23/2021. Follow up LFT on 12/25/2021 showed ALT 39, AST 31, ***** 117, total bilirubin 0.4. However, in mid January 2022, he noticed jaundice. Repeat LFT showed significant rise in ***** on 01/26/2022 with ALT 426, AST 342, ***** 1354, total bilirubin 34.8. He was admitted at *****. MRCP did not show any obstructive lesion. Subsequently, she underwent liver biopsy on 01/28/2022 showing nonspecific hepatitis with bile duct injury most consistent with drug induced liver injury. Subsequent, ***** stopped.     Since 01/25/2022, ***** has stopped. The LFT is progressively imrpoving. The most recent LFT on 03/19/2022 show total bilirubin 1.3, ***** 367, and AST 66 and ALT 50.  He was not started on any other chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimen yet.     Prior to starting clinical trial, he underwent work up for chronic liver disease including viral hepatitis with Hep C RNA not detected, Hep C Ab low positive, Hep B surf Ab 295, Hep B core Ab total positive, Hep B surf Ag negative, Hep B DNA not detected, HIV Ag/Ab negative. Also work up for autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease on November 2020 were negative with ***** negative, smooth muscle antibody negative, ANA titer 40, A1AT 129. The imaging on 11/26/2021 did not show any evidence of hepatic metastasis, no clear biliary ductal dilation and fatty liver changes. \"\nPunctate hypodensity in liver with no change compared to prior studies. He has never developed any acute hepatitis. He has never been on therapy for hepatitis B. He was given prescription for entecavir before starting chemotherapy. He has history of moderate to heavy alcohol use. He used to drink April 10 beer on most days. He usually drank more while watching soccer.

Attention follow-up is recommended for hypodensity seen in the liver, but no change is seen between the current exam and the prior.    MRCP 01/27/2022  1. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  2. No suspicious hepatic masses with scattered hepatic cysts and hemangiomas which are stable dating back to 04/13/2012.  3. Pathologic T10 vertebral body fracture in the setting of osseous metastasis. Otherwise, no evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen.    CT Abdomen/Pelvis 11/26/2021 showed no convincing evidence of new metastases. Punctate hypodensity in segment 8 of liver is too small to characterize although similar compared to 09/09/2021, attention on follow-up. Decreased thickening and enhancement of bandlike soft tissue in the pelvis.     US Abdomen 11/26/2021 showed normal hepatic Dopplers. Unchanged hepatic hemangiomas. No sonographic findings to explain reported transaminitis. New 1.4 cm gallbladder polyp or less likely sludge.     CT Abdomen/Pelvis 09/09/2021 showed on the prior study dated 08/20/2021 new band like soft tissue was \"\nidentified along the left mesorectum and extending to the presacral region and abutting the left seminal vesicle. This appearance is again identified with marked enhancement of the second tissue on this contrast-enhanced study. The appearance is more inflammatory than neoplastic. However the origin of the inflammation is not clearly identified. There is no definite communication to the rectum or evidence of fistula or diverticulitis. Inflammatory changes in the midline of the seminal vesicles are noted.    CT Abdomen/Pelvis 08/20/2021 showed compared to 05/05/2021, new bandlike soft tissue measuring approximately 4.4 x 1.0 cm extending along the left mesorectum to the presacral region and obliterating the fat plane with the left seminal vesicle. This would be an unusual appearance for metastasis, but tumor involvement is a consideration. If clinically warranted MR pelvis with contrast can be obtained.     CT Chest, Abdomen/Pelvis 05/05/2021 showed a solid hypermetabolic right upper lobe pulmonary nodule has mildly increased size compared to 04/01/2021 and is suspicious for primary pulmonary malignancy. Subcentimeter lytic lesions in the left posterolateral sixth rib, T8 vertebral body, and T10 vertebral body with hypermetabolism are indeterminate but raise suspicious for sites of metastatic disease given gradual enlargement since 2018. MRI of the thoracic spine could be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated. A high attenuation 1.1 cm lesion in the region of the third ventricle without hypermetabolism may represent a colloid cyst but is incompletely evaluated. Consider brain MRI for further characterization if clinically indicated.    CT Abdomen 04/01/2021 showed hepatic steatosis. Small cyst in right hepatic lobe. There are two hyperenhancing lesions in the right and left lobes as well as a hypodense lesion in the left lobe, previously characterized as hemangiomas on 04/13/2012 CT. No evidence of \"\nmalignancy in the abdomen.    US Abdomen 03/19/2021 showed mild hepatic steatosis unchanged along with 3 known hepatic hemangiomas is characterized on CT from 0 April 2012.    US of abdomen on 11/22/2019  Liver: The liver span is 17.1 cm. Liver parenchyma is diffusely increased in echogenicity is similar to prior June 2017 exam. Again noted are 3 hypoechoic liver lesions, 2 in the left hepatic lobe measuring 1.0-1.4 cm and a third 1.6 cm lesion adjacent to the gallbladder fundus. These were previously shown to be hemangiomas on a April 2012 CT and are stable in size. Benign-appearing right hepatic lobe 8 mm cyst is again seen. Spleen: Measures 8.1 cm. Normal in size.    Cardiology  Chest ***** 09/11/2021 showed unchanged right upper lung opacity. No substantial pneumothorax. Unchanged mediastinal silhouette.     CT Chest 09/09/2021 showed compared to 08/20/2021, unchanged burden of metastatic disease in the chest unchanged dominant right upper lobe lesion and similar appearance of osseous lesions in the spine and ribs.    CT Chest 08/20/2021 showed compared to 05/05/2021, increased burden of metastatic disease in the chest as evidenced by increased size of masslike consolidation in the right upper lobe, newly enlarged 1.6 cm subcarinal lymph node, increased size of multiple lytic lesions in the spine and ribs as well as a a few new lytic osseous lesions. Of note, there is a small amount of osseous destruction along the posterior aspect of the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies without definite evidence of spinal canal invasion, however recommend correlation with neurologic exam. A slowly enlarging 1.7 cm cystic lesion in the left upper lobe is suspicious metachronous adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesion.    Chest ***** 05/15/2021 showed no pneumothorax.    CT Chest Biopsy 05/15/2021 showed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Consolidated lung parenchyma with invasive adenocarcinoma. The tumor shows acinar, and cribriform architecture. The tumor cells are moderately \"\npleomorphic and contain occasional mucinous vacuoles. Several mitoses are identified.     CT Chest 04/01/2021 showed right upper lobe mass measuring up to 2.5 cm, concerning for malignancy. Clustered tree-in-bud nodules in the right lower lobe and scattered calcified biapical nodules, likely reflecting chronic infection or sequela thereof.    Endoscopy  EGD 03/16/2021 showed the entire examined duodenum appeared normal. There was mild antral gastropathy noted with no significant pathologic abnormality. The mucosa of the esophagus appeared normal.     Colonoscopy 03/16/2021 showed mild non-bleeding diverticulosis in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. Five sessile polyps ranging from 6 to 12mm in size were found in the ascending colon and transverse colon; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Two sessile polyps ranging from 4 to 6mm in size were found in the sigmoid colon and rectum; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Retroflexed views revealed internal hemorrhoids. Prep was poor.  No very large polyp or mass, however, and no cause for weight loss found. Right colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma and tubulovillous adenoma. Left colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma.     Pathology  Liver biopsy on 01/29/2022  The liver biopsy shows hepatitis with multifocal bile duct injury. In  view of the temporal profile of elevation of liver enzymes following  reinstitution of sotorasib and improvement of liver enzyme  profile/bilirubin after drug cessation, the overall picture can be  compatible with drug-induced liver injury (*****). A mixed  hepatitic-cholestatic injury is common in *****. Other etiologies like  biliary obstruction, sepsis, ***** ***** etc. do not appear to be  relevant based on the clinical setting. The negative stains for EBV,  adenovirus and CMV do not support a viral etiology.       ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. male with a \"\n"},

Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools. My location is in a UCSF clinical facility.       ID: ***** is a very pleasant ***** yo woman with hx of primary bronchogenic adenocarcinoma, stage IIIA diagnosed when she was admitted for pancreatitis in April 2020.    HPI: The patient has history of hypertension, anxiety, and SIADH, and presented to the emergency room on 05/13/20 with complaints of chest pain and upper abdominal pain. She did report consumption of nearly one bottle of wine per day although was trying to cut back due to the pain. She denied any cough or weight loss. She is a smoker and has used one pack per day for 30 years although at some point she was able to quit for 2 years but restarted smoking during COVID. She recently moved to ***** ***** from ***** ***** approximately one year ago, and she lives with her nephew. In the emergency room she had CT scan of chest abdomen and pelvis which showed a spiculated left upper lobe nodule suspicious for primary lung malignancy, and enlarged left hilar and AP window lymph nodes of 13 and 10 mm respectively. There were also some smaller nodules in both lungs which were nonspecific, as well as moderate emphysema, small pericardial effusion, bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and nodularity suspicious for metastatic disease but nonspecific. There were also coarse calcifications in the pancreas consistent with prior episodes of pancreatitis, ill-defined soft tissue infiltration between stomach and pancreas likely inflammatory, small amount of ascites, heterogeneous uterus, and suggestion of possible left adnexal mass versus \"\ntolerated. PET/CT scan at completion of chemo showed very good partial response.  She then underwent left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection at ***** by Dr ***** on 12/13/20. Pathology showed residual high grade 2.5 cm adenocarcinoma and 6 positive lymph nodes, without extracapsular extension, but there was lymphovascular invasion. She completed adjuvant radiation therapy to the mediastinum over 5 weeks, which was also very well tolerated, ending in March 2021. She then completed adjuvant Atezolizumab X 18 doses, last on 05/08/22.    Unfortunately she presented with metastatic disease to lymph nodes on imaging in July 2022. This was biopsy-proven from the left supraclavicular lymph node that shows adenocarcinoma of lung primary.  Lymphadenopathy was up to 2 cm in size, and bilateral cervical, left axillary, mediastinal, aortocaval and gastrohepatic regions. NGS panel from left SCL LN as well as from prior lung tissue showed ***** p.***** mutation.  Therefore ***** was started on sotorasib 960 mg daily and so far this is very well tolerated. CBC and LFTs remain normal.  Next labs prior to the CT in about 1 month.  We will plan a CT C/A/P after she has been on sotorasib X 3 months, ie ***** of December 2022 - s/f 12/22/22.    ***** has also met with Dr ***** and palliative care team. She was interested in learning more about the right to die at. She would like to have a plan for the future as she does not have a lot of support in this area; she lives in ***** ***** with strangers and does not want to end up in a nursing home.    # Hx pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation: pancreatitis is resolved and pancreatic tail cyst is now resolved. She is asymptomatic. She uses pancreatic enzymes with meals.    # Hx SIADH. This has been a chronic problem prior to her cancer diagnosis. She did have a recent hospitalization for severe hyponatremia and did establish care with nephrology. She is on NaCl tabs and will cont 2 tablets \"\ndaily.    # Hx hypothyroidism, worsened with autoimmune thyroiditis: on synthroid, managed by Dr *****. Recently dose was reduced.    # *****: on Lipitor now, tolerating well.     # Follow-up: after the CT scan in December. She will eventually transition care to Dr *****.    # Emotional support       #  Pain  Pain assessment for this encounter  There were no vitals filed for this visit.    Pain management plan outlined below as of 11/13/22   n/a      Below for billing only         I spent a total of 30 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.                                   \"\ncolon configuration. Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe 2.4 cm masslike density. Abdominal ultrasound was consistent with pancreatitis and extensive pancreatic calcifications. She was admitted for treatment of pancreatitis.  During the admission, she underwent CT-guided biopsy of the left upper lobe lung mass. Pathology has come back as adenocarcinoma arising in association with a fibroid last 6 car. PD L1 DPS score was strong positive in 95%. Additional molecular markers were requested. I had recommended a PET scan to be done as outpatient and she is now returning to discuss that. In addition she had pelvic ultrasound on 05/14/20 prior to leaving the hospital which showed myomatous uterus but normal appearing ovaries bilaterally and no left adnexal mass detected.  She saw pulmonology, Dr *****, for EBUS and bx of the AP window lymph node - was not successful. After a discussion at our local tumor board, recs were made for referral to thoracic surgery to complete staging and evaluation for surgery. She saw Dr ***** ***** but also wanted to be seen by a thoracic surgeon specifically and was therefore referred to ***** ***** ***** at *****.    NGS testing showed ***** p.***** mutation in 3% of cells.    PAST THERAPY: s/p 4 cycles of neoadjuvant Carboplatin and Pemetrexed, C4D1 on 10/07/20.  12/13/20: S/p ***** lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node resection by Dr *****,  revealing 2.5cm residual tumor (40% viable), high grade, +LVI, negative margins, June 21 LNs involved (no *****), *****.  02/08/21-03/15/21: adjuvant XRT 5000 cGy in 25 fractions.  Atezolizumab q 21 days, started 04/21/2021, for total of 18 doses, last 05/08/22.    Unfortunately PET scan on 08/14/22 showed metastatic disease in mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  PET scan showed only involvement of the lymph nodes but no visceral organs (including 20 mm right cervical lymph node with SUV of 5.9, left supraclavicular 2.6 cm lymph node with SUV of 4.85, \"\nleft 15 mm axillary lymph node with SUV of 6.6, 2.4 cm subcarinal lymph node with SUV of 2.79, 8 mm anterior mediastinal lymph node with SUV of 2.29, and then additional aortocaval, periaortic, and gastrohepatic adenopathy with SUV of 3.88).  Brain MRI showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  On 08/21/2022 she underwent ultrasound biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph node with pathology showing metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary.  PDL-L1 was 30%.    CURRENT THERAPY: Lumakras (Sotorasib) 960 mg daily started 09/17/22.         Interval history since last visit and relevant symptoms   I saw ***** ***** ***** ***** follow-up. ***** reports feeling well and she still has not noticed any side effects of Sotorasib. She has good energy and has not had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or water retention. She denies any shortness of breath or cough. She is able to walk daily with no problems. Her weight is stable. ***** met with Dr ***** and his team and is in touch with SW, and will be meeting with Dr ***** end of November. She is taking 2 NaCl tabs daily.

Review of Prior Imaging: I personally reviewed and interpreted each of the patient's relevant imaging studies in conjunction with the co ***** formal radiology reports, as outlined in my \"\nHPI/Oncologic History     08/14/22: PET scan  IMPRESSION:     1. Hypermetabolic metastatic lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, and abdomen, as detailed above.     2. Status post left upper lobectomy. Mild wedge-shaped soft tissue and/or fluid noted along the resection margin with associated mild hypermetabolism peripherally (SUV max 2.76, March 26:64), nonspecific.     3. Mild patchy interstitial and groundglass opacities noted throughout the left lower lobe with areas of associated mild hypermetabolism (SUV max 2.83); these findings are new compared to ***** chest 08/07/2022, and thus favored to be infectious/inflammatory in etiology.       08/12/22: MRI brain  IMPRESSION:     1. No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.     2. Mild burden of chronic white matter small vessel ischemic change.     08/07/22: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:     1. Compared to 02/13/2022 there is progression of metastatic disease with increased size and number of mediastinal, left subpectoral, retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy as described above.     2. Stable postsurgical changes status post left upper lobectomy without evidence of local disease recurrence.       04/22/22: CT brain non-con  IMPRESSION:     1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, herniation or hydrocephalus.     2. Chronic white matter small vessel ischemic change.     02/13/22: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:   1. Postop changes in the chest (left upper lobectomy) without evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Diminished left pleural fluid collection as above.   2. No infradiaphragmatic metastatic disease detected. Resolved pancreatic cyst; stable left adreniform fullness.     07/21/21: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:   1. Postop changes left upper lobectomy, stable loculated left anterior superior pleural fluid collection. Tiny left posterior-inferior pleural effusion.   2. Shotty mediastinal/left hilar nodes.   3. Sequela of chronic pancreatitis with multiple calcifications + new \"\napproximately 14 mm nonenhancing pancreatic tail cyst.   4. Nonspecific mild dilation of few small bowel loops, correlate clinically.     04/04/21 CT C/A/P:  IMPRESSION:     1. Status post left upper lobectomy without evidence of residual parenchymal disease. Anterior left pleural thickening and small loculated effusion are likely post surgical in etiology.   2. Stable few shotty mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes which are not pathologically enlarged.   3. No definite evidence of metastatic disease in abdomen and pelvis.   4. Stable nodularity of the left greater than right adrenal glands, likely reflecting adenomatous change.   5. Chronic pancreatitis with resolution of a prior pancreatic tail cystic lesion/collection and near resolution of a small anterior peripancreatic fluid collection.       PET scan + CT chest w contrast 10/20/20:  IMPRESSION:   1. Spiculated left upper lobe pulmonary nodule measuring 18 x 13 mm with ***** SUV 4.3, mildly decreasing since last exam when it measured 22 x 13 mm with ***** SUV 6.7.   2. Mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy is also significantly decreasing since last exam in both size and metabolic activity, now basically not pathologically enlarged; highest metabolic activity in a nonenlarged left hilar node measuring max SUV 3.6 (previously 5.5 max SUV).   3. No definite metastatic disease in the abdomen pelvis   4. Stable bilateral nodular adrenal glands, presumably adenomatous change.   5. Unchanged pseudocyst between the pancreas and stomach, possibly new 14 mm pseudocyst in the tail the pancreas, with chronic pancreatitis.    PET scan 08/13/20:  IMPRESSION:   1. Revisualization of the hypermetabolic known left upper lobe lung cancer.   2. ***** left hilar adenopathy. Prevascular, low left paratracheal and AP window adenopathy.   3. ***** bilateral adrenal nodularity, left more than right, stable. The findings are not entirely specific but likely represent \"\nbenign adenomatous change given the lack of ***** hypermetabolism.   4. Further interval slight enlargement of a ***** fluid collection interposed between the stomach and pancreas, possibly representing an enlarging, maturing pseudocyst. The lack of ***** hypermetabolism is reassuring.            Pathology   08/21/22: U/S guided FNA left SCL LN  FINAL MICROSCOPIC DIAGNOSIS:   Metastatic adenocarcinoma.   See Comment     COMMENT:   Aspirate smears are sparsely cellular with cellular and composed of only   rare atypical cells.

Very extensive/diffuse patchy/hazy opacities elsewhere throughout the lung fields bilaterally that are progressive in extent from the patient's prior PET/CT, as detailed above.  There are particularly dense/confluent, more significantly hypermetabolic opacities throughout the left lower pulmonary lobe and lingula that have progressed in extent from the patient's prior PET/CT (though they demonstrate mixed changes in metabolism).  A widely disseminated, evolving/progressing infectious/inflammatory process is strongly suspected, though a pulmonary malignancy or superimposed malignancy (potentially with surrounding lymphangitic or \"\ninfiltrative tumor spread) cannot be entirely excluded. There are underlying mild pulmonary emphysematous changes, as well as a few small (subcentimeter) lung nodules that are too small to definitively characterize. Other likely-benign findings (as detailed above), with no specific metabolic evidence of malignant or metastatic disease outside of the lungs.    -09/26/2021-10/02/2021: Admitted to UCSF with hypoxia and shortness of breath and underwent expedited work up.

INTERVAL HISTORY:  -10/27/2022 CT chest: No significant pulmonary embolus on either side. \"\nPosttreatment changes in the right lung apex, interval improvement in the consolidative opacity in the left lower lobe with a 4.2 x 2.1 cm lobular density in the left infrahilar region, the left lower lobe, possible residual malignancy versus metastatic disease cannot be excluded. Further evaluation with PET CT scan can be performed. Development of sclerotic lesions in the sternum and T4 vertebral body, left seventh rib, likely representing metastatic disease.   -12/06/2022 PET/CT: There has been a slight progression of metastatic disease in the bone and soft tissue as above. There is limited evaluation of brain and breasts.     Review of systems:  - Feels great overall  - She went on a three week vacation to Europe. One day she walked 7 miles, the other day she walked 9 miles. She felt really well overall. They went to croatia, prague, ireland, *****. She went with her whole family. ***** trip.  - She had a few days of pleurisy last month. That improved, but she then developed shingles on her right side (abdomen to right back). She received ACV but not until day 4, has developed some post-herpetic neuropathy. Pain is pretty bad, she is taking gabapentin. She is taking gabapentin 100 mg TID.   - She is tolerating the sotorasib very well. Only real side effect is that she bruises more easily and she get cramps in her hands that she never used to get.   - Overall she feels fine.  - She hasn't used oxygen since mid August!  - She has a dentist, they have cleared her to start bone health agent which I am very supportive of starting.

Imaging result in interval history above.   Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)                 12/06/22 0000  PETCT Limited Whole Body Vertex to Mid Thigh (Storage Only) Final result    Narrative:  This is a study performed outside UCSF and stored for the purposes of    comparison as requested by  Not In System Radiology Provider.                  Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with remote history of a RUL lung adenocarcinoma, treated initially back in 2009 for a ***** cancer with ***** \"\nwith cisplatin/pemetrexed then downstaged to T2N0 and taken to surgery. Then many years late developed with increasing bilateral consolidations and diffuse groundglass, worst in the LLL, s/p several negative biopsies but ultimately found to have biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her recent lung biopsy here at *****. It took several procedures to come up with the diagnosis, but finally CT-guided biopsy did confirm cancer. I suspect this is a separate primary than her original lung cancer back in 2009. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma was suspected based on radiographic appearance, the path here is consistent with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ***** showed a ***** ***** mutation and PD-L1 was 0%.      Based on bilateral lung involvement on PET/CT and CT scans, the patient appears to have stage ***** disease. No clear distant metastatic disease outside of the thorax, however. We discussed the fact that stage ***** disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.      I previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. ***** ***** is an actionable mutation, with sotorasib and adagrasib approved as targeted therapy albeit technically approved in the 2L after chemotherapy +/- *****. Therefore, we started with carboplatin/pemetrexed alone (held off on immunotherapy initially given her recent infectious complications, deconditioning, and initially borderline performance status). She tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well overall in terms of symptoms and energy. Restaging scans on 12/22/2021 show some areas of improvement/resolution (right lung and *****) but with persistent patchy consolidation in *****, some areas decreased and others potentially increased but \"\nconfounded by post-obstructive changes. Also important to note that a month and a half elapsed from prior pre-treatment scan in September and when she actually started treatment in November. Therefore in the absence of clear evidence of progression we planned to continue. However there was initially some delay due to recurrent Cdiff+ and diarrhea, and then there was concern about a carboplatin reaction. She received one cycle of pemetrexed alone and then two additional cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. Restaging PET/CT scans on 04/27/2022; hard to say based on non-diagnostic CT scan the extent of progression. The bone findings do have CT correlates and do appear new. There has been improvement in ***** findings, possibly more uptake in consolidative LLL mass-like lesion, but hard to tell extent of progression without a diagnostic scan.     There was reasonable concern for some progression given the new hypermetabolic bone metastases, and possibly some progression in the left lung. Ultimately she preferred  ***** therapy SoC over our ***** 101 clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy, started sotorasib in 06/27/2022. She tolerated tx very well so far. Only side effect is easy bruising. Today, we reviewed PET/CT from 12/06/2022. There does appear to be slight interval progression in the bones and a single soft tissue lesion--but it's fairly subtle. Overall she feels great still, improved compared to last 6-12 months. Therefore, I would recommend continuing sotorasib for now, and getting short interval follow up scans in 2 months or so. At that time, if more definitive progression, can discuss other treatment options. She has never had a checkpoint inhibitor, so I would favor an immunotherapy-based approach as next line treatment - either pembrolizumab alone or potentially ***** + docetaxel as per the PROLONG study (***** et al., 2020).      #Lung adenocarcinoma  Suspect stage ***** disease given bilateral lung \"\ninvolvement on scans. ***** NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 0%. Very symptomatic at diagnosis, requiring 4L supplemental oxygen. And then was significantly deconditioned with ECOG PS 3 following several hospitalizations for cdiff/PNA/sepsis and associated bedrest. Fortunately she improved significantly with treatment of her infections and the initiation of chemotherapy. ECOG PS subsequently improved to ~1. Her April 2022 scans were concerning for progressive disease in the bones, and possibly also in the left lung s/p C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed. She was subsequently switched to sotorasib. Scans in 08/21/22 demonstrated partial response. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 with interval PD in the bones and one soft tissue lesion, but subtle. She continues to feel great overall, better than before. So we will continue sotorasib for now and plan short interval scans in 2 months. At that point, if ongoing progression would consider immunotherapy-based treatment (e.g. *****, alone or possibly with docetaxel).     - Continue Sotorasib 960 mg/day for now given significant and ongoing clinical improvement   - PET/CT from 08/21/22 with reported partial response, particularly with mass-like LLL consolidation smaller and less PET avid  - PET from 12/06/2022 shows some early progression in the bones; but she continues to feel great, better than on prior chemo regimen so discussed continuing a bit longer and getting a short interval PET in 2 months   - Recommendations discussed with Dr. *****  - At time of more significant progression, consider ***** +/- docetaxel     #Bone metastases  We discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and \"\n"},

He was found to have ***** ***** mutation driving his tumor, which has a targeted therapy available but in the 2nd line. He ***** carboplatin, pemetrexed, and ***** (rather than ***** single agent given extensive disease burden) and also had radiation to spine and rib. Restaging scans after C2 showed clear improvement in chest but some bones were with increase in size and invasion, including C3 with further loss of ventral height and some apparent increase in hepatic tumors as well. He was evaluated in the ED and surgical decompression recommended though not urgently. Then we reviewed PET/CT after C3, requested to evaluate possible mixed response, and this was actually reassuring compared to 03/17/22, with clear pulmonary and nodal improvement, hepatic lesions NOT avid, and overall LESS avidity in bones, even though some lytic lesions had increased in size. We then elected given good response but poor chemo tolerability to proceed with ***** alone esp given high PD-L1. However, imaging after 2 cycles on ***** alone, he had progression in liver and adrenal glands as well as thoracic lung and nodal disease.    We then started on sotorasib.

Previously described right middle and right lower lobe pulmonary nodules are not definitively seen on today's study. Similar lower lobe predominant consolidative changes and groundglass opacities.  Abdominal and pelvic organs: Index lesion as above. Additional hypermetabolic hepatic foci, some of which do not demonstrate a discrete CT correlate in the noncontrast overall decreased in size and number compared to prior PET from 07/04/2022. Resolved left and persistent mild right adrenal gland hypermetabolism. Resolved diffuse splenic hypermetabolism.  Bones: Index lesion as above. Additional new foci of hypermetabolism involving the bilateral proximal humeri, T10 vertebral body, left proximal femur, increased extent of hypermetabolism along the sternum, and now diffusely throughout the right iliac wing and sacrum. Of note, the sacral lesion demonstrates similar morphology with persistent effacement of the left S2/S3 sacral neural foramen. However, decreased hypermetabolism involving the C6 and T8 vertebral bodies. Otherwise, similar hypermetabolism throughout known thoracic, lumbar, bilateral rib, manubrial, osseous pelvis, and right femoral metastases.  Other: No metastases.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  -August 2021 Patient presented with back pain.   -08/27/21 CT chest (CPMC): 1.3 x 3.5 cm spiculated bilobed nodule at the right middle lobe. Patchy sclerosis and rarefaction at T3 along with height loss at endplates. No significant vertebral body retropulsion or obvious epidural mass.   -09/04/2021 Consultation with Dr. *****. EBUS/biopsy was scheduled but patient tested COVID+ on 09/12/2021 (incidental positive on pre-procedure screening test) and procedure was cancelled. Planned for further imaging and biopsy of one of the peripheral bone lesions.   -09/07/21 MRI brain: neg  -09/08/21 MRI T spine: T3 pathologic fracture with approximately 50% height loss and associated mild posterior retropulsion into the spinal canal without significant spinal canal stenosis. No cord compression or cord signal abnormality. Associated anterior and posterior subligamentous soft tissue enhancement as well as abnormal enhancement within the posterior aspect of the adjacent T1, T2, and T4 vertebral bodies. Differential considerations include metastatic disease versus atypical infection such as tuberculosis. Consider further evaluation with \"\nPET/CT as well as CT-guided biopsy.  -09/11/21 PET/CT: Mildly hypermetabolic nodule along the right middle lobe is concerning for primary lung malignancy, with avid mediastinal nodes concerning for nodal involvement. Foci of osseous hypermetabolism in the right iliac spine and left femur are concerning for osseous metastasis. In light of this, wedge compression deformity with hypermetabolism is also concerning for a pathologic fracture although technically indeterminate as associated hypermetabolism may be reactive.   -10/08/21 CT bone biopsy:   -Path: metastatic carcinoma of lung primary   -QNS for *****, PD-L1  -10/19/21 Radiation oncology evaluation: Recommend palliative RT 20Gy in 5fx for T2-T4 spine, consider local consolidative RT depending on response to systemic therapy     INTERVAL HISTORY:  -10/30/21 EBUS with Dr. *****   -Path: Station 7 node: metastatic non-small cell carcinoma, positive for *****, napsin-A, P40 (rare positive cells). ***** and  Napsin-A positivity is consistent with an adenocarcinoma from lung primary site.

He was found to have ***** ***** mutation driving his tumor, which has a targeted therapy available but in the 2nd line. He ***** carboplatin, pemetrexed, and ***** (rather than ***** single agent given extensive disease burden) and also had radiation to spine and rib. Restaging scans after C2 showed clear improvement in chest but some bones were with increase in size and invasion, including C3 with further loss of ventral height and some apparent increase in hepatic tumors as well. He was evaluated in the ED and surgical decompression recommended though not urgently. Then we reviewed PET/CT after C3, requested to evaluate possible mixed response, and this was actually reassuring compared to 03/17/22, with clear pulmonary and nodal improvement, hepatic lesions NOT avid, and overall LESS avidity in bones, even though some lytic lesions had increased in size. We then elected given good response but poor chemo tolerability to proceed with ***** alone esp given high PD-L1. However, imaging after 2 cycles on ***** alone, he had progression in liver and adrenal glands as well as thoracic lung and nodal disease.    We then started on sotorasib 07/15/22.

On balance, this supports staying on sotorasib, and I recommended next scans with PET in 6-8 weeks, PET to cont to help clarify bony disease status given extensive extent.    He then had marked fatigue and episodes of AMS especially overnight. He has also had some urinary incontinence. He had CPMC admission with extensive workup that was unrevealing, notably including MRI spine without LMD which was a concern. We decided to hold sotorasib for a couple of days, and today will restart at February 16 dose.    Today on report these AMS episodes have persisted in frequency though perhaps a bit less intense. After such complete workup, my ddx includes LMD despite no radiographic evidence given his large burden of bony disease and delerium that is med-associated and sleep-wake cycle disruption-associated.

He was found to have ***** ***** mutation driving his tumor, which has a targeted therapy available but in the 2nd line. He ***** carboplatin, pemetrexed, and ***** (rather than ***** single agent given extensive disease burden) and also had radiation to spine and rib. Restaging scans after C2 showed clear improvement in chest but some bones were with increase in size and invasion, including C3 with further loss of ventral height and some apparent increase in hepatic tumors as well. He was evaluated in the ED and surgical decompression recommended though not urgently. Then we reviewed PET/CT after C3, requested to evaluate possible mixed response, and this was actually reassuring compared to 03/17/22, with clear pulmonary and nodal improvement, hepatic lesions NOT avid, and overall LESS avidity in bones, even though some lytic lesions had increased in size.    We then elected given good response but poor chemo tolerability to proceed with ***** alone esp given high PD-L1. However, imaging after 2 cycles on ***** alone, he had progression in liver and adrenal glands as well as thoracic lung and nodal disease.    We previously had a long discussion today about options in light of progression with options as follows:  --***** inhibitors as SOC 2nd line, sotorasib vs adagrasib-- no head to head data, either reasonable, adagrasib with more CNS benefit on data presented to date, but more tox  --add ***** +/- carbo back since PD is only after d/c-- but discussed tox issues when was on 3 drug combo, acknowledging also with bone pain at that time \"\nsince resolved and at that time recently s/p rads with its own tox profile    After the visit he elected sotorasib.

Multiple right-sided pulmonary nodules, extensive multistation thoracic lymphadenopathy, and multifocal osseous lesions with associated hypermetabolism, consistent with pulmonary, nodal, and osseous metastases. Associated pathologic fracture of the C3 vertebral body. Additionally, soft tissue component associated with the L5 vertebral body lesion partially extends into the spinal canal. Total spine MRI is recommended for further evaluation. Focus of hypermetabolism in the left hepatic lobe without clear CT correlate.  -03/17/22 MRI Brain: No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. ***** abnormality involving the C3 vertebral body with adjacent prevertebral soft tissue swelling, most compatible with osseous metastatic disease. No evidence of cord compression or significant osseous retropulsion.   -03/19/22 MRI Spine: Multilevel diffuse osseous metastases throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Mild loss of vertebral body height at C3. At L5, there is a component of epidural disease contributing to moderate canal stenosis. No evidence of leptomeningeal disease.

Seen in-person    Subjective:     IDENTIFICATION: ***** y.o. male with history of smoking, recently diagnosed stage IV lung carcinoma (bone; ***** *****, PD-L1 5%), here for follow-up on sotorasib.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  -August 2021 Patient presented with back pain.   -08/27/21 CT chest (CPMC): 1.3 x 3.5 cm spiculated bilobed nodule at the right middle lobe. Patchy sclerosis and rarefaction at T3 along with height loss at endplates. No significant vertebral body retropulsion or obvious epidural mass.   -09/04/2021 Consultation with Dr. *****. EBUS/biopsy was scheduled but patient tested COVID+ on 09/12/2021 (incidental positive on pre-procedure screening test) and procedure was cancelled. Planned for further imaging and biopsy of one of the peripheral bone lesions.   -09/07/21 MRI brain: neg  -09/08/21 MRI T spine: T3 pathologic fracture with approximately 50% height loss and associated mild posterior retropulsion into the spinal canal without significant spinal canal stenosis. No cord compression or cord signal abnormality. Associated anterior and posterior subligamentous soft tissue enhancement as well as abnormal enhancement within the posterior aspect of the adjacent T1, T2, and T4 vertebral bodies. Differential considerations include metastatic disease versus atypical infection such as tuberculosis. Consider further evaluation with PET/CT as well as CT-guided biopsy.  -09/11/21 PET/CT: Mildly hypermetabolic nodule along the right middle lobe is concerning for primary lung malignancy, with avid mediastinal nodes concerning for nodal involvement. Foci of osseous hypermetabolism in the right iliac spine and left femur are concerning for osseous metastasis. In light of this, wedge compression deformity with hypermetabolism is also concerning for a pathologic fracture although technically indeterminate as \"\nPRN, add tylenol PRN (<4G/day).

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma involving bone and possibly liver, ***** *****, PD-L1 80%, s/p radiation to spine and rib, s/p carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab x 3 with response, then decided to do go to ***** single agent, s/p 2 cycles, with progression, now on sotorasib since June 2022 with response, here in follow-up.    # Stage IV adenocarcinoma. He was found to have ***** ***** mutation driving his tumor, which has a targeted therapy available but in the 2nd line. He ***** carboplatin, pemetrexed, and ***** (rather than ***** single agent given extensive disease burden) and also had radiation to spine and rib. Restaging scans after C2 showed clear improvement in chest but some bones were with increase in size and invasion, including C3 with further loss of ventral height and some apparent increase in hepatic tumors as well. He was evaluated in the ED and surgical decompression recommended though not urgently. Then we reviewed PET/CT after C3, requested to evaluate possible mixed response, and this was actually reassuring compared to 03/17/22, with clear pulmonary and nodal improvement, hepatic lesions NOT avid, and overall LESS avidity in bones, even though some lytic lesions had increased in size. We then elected given good response but poor chemo tolerability to proceed with ***** alone esp given high PD-L1. However, imaging after 2 cycles on ***** alone, he had progression in liver and adrenal glands as well as thoracic lung and nodal disease.    We then started on sotorasib.

L5 vertebral body lytic lesion with soft tissue component extending into the spinal canal: Approximately 3.5 x 1.9 cm (series 201 image *****) with a maximum SUV of 3.2, previously 3.3 x 2.5 cm with a maximum SUV of 3.7.    4. Peripheral right hepatic lobe lesion: Approximately 2.7 x 2.0 cm (series 201 image *****) with a maximum SUV of 7.1, previously 4.2 x 3.0 cm with a maximum SUV of 5.9. Similar central photopenia favoring necrosis.    Lymph nodes: Index lesion as above. Interval decreased size to resolution of previously seen bilateral hilar, mediastinal, right axillary/subpectoral, and right retrocrural/retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Persistent hypermetabolism within a right paratracheal node (series 1503 image *****).  Lungs: Right upper lobe mass as described above. Previously described right middle and right lower lobe pulmonary nodules are not definitively seen on today's study. Similar lower lobe predominant consolidative changes and groundglass opacities.  Abdominal and pelvic organs: Index lesion as above. Additional hypermetabolic hepatic foci, some of which do not demonstrate a discrete CT correlate in the noncontrast overall decreased in size and number compared to prior PET from 07/04/2022. Resolved left and persistent mild right adrenal gland hypermetabolism. Resolved diffuse splenic hypermetabolism.  Bones: Index lesion as above. Additional new foci of hypermetabolism involving the bilateral proximal humeri, T10 vertebral body, left proximal femur, increased extent of hypermetabolism along the sternum, and now diffusely throughout the right iliac wing and sacrum. Of note, the sacral lesion demonstrates similar morphology with \"\npersistent effacement of the left S2/S3 sacral neural foramen. However, decreased hypermetabolism involving the C6 and T8 vertebral bodies. Otherwise, similar hypermetabolism throughout known thoracic, lumbar, bilateral rib, manubrial, osseous pelvis, and right femoral metastases.  Other: No metastases.    Non-oncologic findings:    Brain: Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. No mass effect.     Neck: Otherwise unremarkable.    Chest: Findings as above. Severe coronary artery calcifications. Similar lower lobe predominant subpleural reticular opacities and traction bronchiectasis.    Abdomen/Pelvis: Left renal cyst. Severe aortoiliac calcifications. Otherwise unremarkable.    Musculoskeletal: Interval resolution of previously described small focus of activity along the scrotal skin favored contamination. Otherwise unremarkable.          1.  Compared to prior PET/CT from 07/06/2022, decreased size and hypermetabolism of the right upper lobe mass, mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, hepatic, and left adrenal metastases.    2.  Additional new foci of hypermetabolism involving the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton as described above, most conspicuous along the right iliac wing and sacrum. However, decreased hypermetabolism of the C6 and T8 vertebral bodies. Otherwise, similar hypermetabolism throughout the remaining known osseous metastases without significant change in morphology.    Report dictated by: ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** *****, MD  Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging      I spent a total of 41 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other \"\nhealthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    \"\ndisease is stable to slightly increased, though there are a couple of sites that are more avid but without CT changed.     On balance, this supports staying on sotorasib, and I rec next scans with PET in 6-8 weeks, PET to cont to help clarify bony disease status given extensive extent.    Symptomatically, he is more anemic, and so we will recheck labs early next week-- if under 8, will trf 3 U, and if under 10, will try to start darbo epo for support.    # Bone metastatic disease: Extensive osseous involvement on PET.

Associated pathologic fracture of the C3 vertebral body. Additionally, soft tissue component associated with the L5 vertebral body lesion partially extends into the spinal canal. Total spine MRI is recommended for further evaluation. Focus of hypermetabolism in the left hepatic lobe without clear CT correlate.  -03/17/22 MRI Brain: No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. ***** abnormality involving the C3 vertebral body with adjacent prevertebral soft tissue swelling, most compatible with osseous metastatic disease.

Following the radiopharmaceutical, a low dose, non-contrast, nondiagnostic CT was obtained for attenuation correction purposes. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 67 minutes after FDG injection. PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data. PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted. Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images. Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 114 mg/dL.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  -2009: RUL lung cancer, s/p RUL lobectomy. Treated initially for a ***** lung cancer, treated initially with definitive ***** with cisplatin/pemetrexed, then downstaged to a T2N0 and was taken to surgery.

Correlate clinically for infection/pneumonia. Band like density/scarring in the medial right upper lung again noted.   -03/11/2021 PET/CT: Findings compatible with severe and worsening multifocal pneumonia, most severely manifested in the left lower lobe. The masslike consolidation of concern has increased in size although has relatively reduced radiotracer uptake compared to \"\nother inflammatory changes in the lungs. This is therefore favored to represent airway plugging and airspace collapse. Recommend follow-up posttreatment CT in 6-8 weeks to reassess and continued imaging to resolution. Right upper lobectomy without convincing visible evidence of recurrent FDG-avid tumor.   -April 2021: Bronch locally, reportedly negative  -06/05/2021 CT chest: Interval enlargement of the left lower lobe dense consolidation/mass superimposed on diffuse groundglass and nodular consolidative opacities suspicious for recurrent lung cancer. By report patient is scheduled for bronchoscopy and/or FNA for definitive diagnosis. Scattered additional new areas of groundglass opacity within the left upper lobe and posterior and central right lung. Single area of peripheral mid right lung. Irregular consolidative opacity. Differential possibilities include multifocal pneumonia or metastatic lung cancer.

Treated with parainfluenza and discharged with higher NC oxygen (4L at rest, up to 6L with activity)   -09/25/2021 CT chest: No acute pulmonary embolism to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. Compared to 07/21/2021, interval increase in bilateral groundglass opacities and interlobular septal thickening as well as masslike consolidation, particularly in the left greater than right lower lobes. Given the patient's history of malignancy, these findings are concerning for worsening bilateral invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma.   -09/29/2021 CT-guided left lower lobe lung biopsy                  Path: pulmonary adenocarcinoma                  IHC: CK7+, ***** negative, TTF-1+, Napsin-A+, P40 negative, CD68 negative, ***** negative                  ***** ***** *****, *****, ***** mutations.

She got benadryl which fixed it.  -12/16/2021: recurrent diarrhea, testing for C diff resent.  -12/23/2021 PET/CT: There is higher uptake in the more consolidated areas of the extensive patchy opacities in the left lower lung compared to the prior scan, of uncertain significance. There is no significant change in the size of the anterior left lung base consolidation and there is a new posterolateral left lower lung consolidation within the extensive patchy opacities in the left lower lobe. There is improvement of the extensive diffuse, patchy opacities in the right lung post upper lobectomy and left upper lobe to the lingula, which may be a response to therapy.   -late January 2022: single dose of pemetrexed due to concerns about carboplatin reaction   -02/22/2022 CT chest: Extensive bilateral infiltrates in both lungs have significantly progressed in the interval, L>R and probably related to pneumonitis or a component of an infectious process. ***** mass in ***** overall mildly improved in the interval. Assessment for smaller tumor foci in both lungs is significantly hampered by extensive bilateral airspace disease. No adenopathy. Small nonspecific pericardial effusion.   -March 17?/2022: C3 carboplatin/pemetrexed (split into two days)   -04/07/2022: C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed   -04/27/2022 PET/CT: Multiple new hypermetabolic bone lesions consistent with bone metastases. Masslike consolidation in the LLL appears similar to 02/22/2022. Extensive bilateral groundglass airspace disease has mildly improved since that time. FDG avidity in the LLL has significantly improved since 12/22/2021.   06/28/22 - CT CAP - Left lower lobe mass with surrounding groundglass and interstitial changes unchanged. There is a new peripheral masslike density in the right middle lobe as well also with surrounding groundglass and interstitial change. Stable osseous metastatic \"\nlesion.

Imaging result in interval history above.   Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with remote history of a RUL lung adenocarcinoma, treated initially back in 2009 for a ***** cancer with ***** with cisplatin/pemetrexed then downstaged to T2N0 and taken to surgery. Then many years late developed with increasing bilateral consolidations and diffuse groundglass, worst in the LLL, s/p several negative biopsies but ultimately found to have biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her recent lung biopsy \"\nhere at *****. It took several procedures to come up with the diagnosis, but finally CT-guided biopsy did confirm cancer. I suspect this is a separate primary than her original lung cancer back in 2009. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma was suspected based on radiographic appearance, the path here is consistent with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ***** showed a ***** ***** mutation and PD-L1 was 0%.      Based on bilateral lung involvement on PET/CT and CT scans, the patient appears to have stage ***** disease. No clear distant metastatic disease outside of the thorax, however. We discussed the fact that stage ***** disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. Of note, she does not have known distant metastatic disease outside the thorax and some of the abnormal findings in the right lung may have represented inflammatory or infectious changes as opposed to malignancy (although cause of the waxing/waning findings is not entirely clear).      Dr. ***** previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. ***** ***** is an actionable mutation, with sotorasib approved as targeted therapy albeit technically approved in the 2L after chemotherapy +/- *****. Therefore, we started with carboplatin/pemetrexed alone (held off on immunotherapy initially given her recent infectious complications, deconditioning, and initially borderline performance status). She tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well overall in terms of symptoms and energy. Restaging scans on 12/22/2021 show some areas of improvement/resolution (right lung and *****) but with persistent patchy consolidation in *****, some areas decreased and others potentially increased but confounded by post-obstructive changes. Also important to note that a month and a half elapsed from prior pre-treatment scan in September and when she actually started treatment in November. \"\nTherefore in the absence of clear evidence of progression we planned to continue. However there was initially some delay due to recurrent Cdiff+ and diarrhea, and then there was concern about a carboplatin reaction. She received one cycle of pemetrexed alone and then two additional cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. Restaging PET/CT scans on 04/27/2022; hard to say based on non-diagnostic CT scan the extent of progression. The bone findings do have CT correlates and do appear new. There has been improvement in ***** findings, possibly more uptake in consolidative LLL mass-like lesion, but hard to tell extent of progression without a diagnostic scan.     Dr. ***** previously discussed with ***** and her daughter that there is reasonable concern for some progression given the new hypermetabolic bone metastases, and possibly some progression in the left lung. Ultimately she prefers tagetes therapy sotorasib over our ***** 101 clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy. She has been on the medication for ~4weeks and tolerating it well. She is planned for a restaging CT CAP on 08/22/22 per local oncologist.    Finally, we discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, she is feeling well today and has no new complaints. I encouraged her to be forthright about any new symptoms as they arise.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Suspect stage ***** disease given bilateral lung involvement on scans, but no clear distant metastatic disease outside the chest, and right sided lung changes may in part be infection or inflammation rather than cancer. ***** NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 0%. Very symptomatic at diagnosis, requiring 4L supplemental oxygen now which is all new in setting of this diagnosis. And then was significantly deconditioned with ECOG PS 3 following several hospitalizations for cdiff/PNA/sepsis and associated bedrest. Fortunately she improved significantly with treatment of her infections and the \"\ninitiation of chemotherapy. ECOG PS has now improved to ~1. Most recent now concern for progressive disease in the bones, and possibly also in the left lung s/p C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed. Plan to switch to sotorasib.  - Continue Sotorasib 960 mg/day   - PET/CT from 04/27/2022 with possible progression in the bones although lung findings look better  - CT c/a/p with IV contrast 08/22/22  - Recommendations discussed with Dr. *****  - Labs q3 weeks locally  - f/u with Dr. ***** following local scans      #*****--recurrent, but now resolved   CTM     #Supportive care - encouraged to contact our office with any questions, concerns of new ***** effects.  F/b *****  On 3L supplemental oxygen now likely due to cancer      RTC in for MD visit ~3 weeks after local scans    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 35 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    \"\n"},

He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded; however complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. Now on treatment break to let liver recover.     CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized \"\nand he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, Dr ***** favored continuing the treatment break. At the time of progression, could consider other gentle chemotherapy.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib 960 mg/day, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with new brain progression, stable chest/A/P disease.

Imaging result in interval history above.   Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with remote history of a RUL lung adenocarcinoma, \"\ntreated initially back in 2009 for a ***** cancer with ***** with cisplatin/pemetrexed then downstaged to T2N0 and taken to surgery. Then many years late developed with increasing bilateral consolidations and diffuse groundglass, worst in the LLL, s/p several negative biopsies but ultimately found to have biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her recent lung biopsy here at *****. It took several procedures to come up with the diagnosis, but finally CT-guided biopsy did confirm cancer. I suspect this is a separate primary than her original lung cancer back in 2009. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma was suspected based on radiographic appearance, the path here is consistent with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ***** showed a ***** ***** mutation and PD-L1 was 0%.      Based on bilateral lung involvement on PET/CT and CT scans, the patient appears to have stage ***** disease. No clear distant metastatic disease outside of the thorax, however. We discussed the fact that stage ***** disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. Of note, she does not have known distant metastatic disease outside the thorax and some of the abnormal findings in the right lung may have represented inflammatory or infectious changes as opposed to malignancy (although cause of the waxing/waning findings is not entirely clear).      Dr. ***** previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. ***** ***** is an actionable mutation, with sotorasib approved as targeted therapy albeit technically approved in the 2L after chemotherapy +/- *****. Therefore, we started with carboplatin/pemetrexed alone (held off on immunotherapy initially given her recent infectious complications, deconditioning, and \"\ninitially borderline performance status). She tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well overall in terms of symptoms and energy. Restaging scans on 12/22/2021 show some areas of improvement/resolution (right lung and *****) but with persistent patchy consolidation in *****, some areas decreased and others potentially increased but confounded by post-obstructive changes. Also important to note that a month and a half elapsed from prior pre-treatment scan in September and when she actually started treatment in November. Therefore in the absence of clear evidence of progression we planned to continue. However there was initially some delay due to recurrent Cdiff+ and diarrhea, and then there was concern about a carboplatin reaction. She received one cycle of pemetrexed alone and then two additional cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. Restaging PET/CT scans on 04/27/2022; hard to say based on non-diagnostic CT scan the extent of progression. The bone findings do have CT correlates and do appear new. There has been improvement in ***** findings, possibly more uptake in consolidative LLL mass-like lesion, but hard to tell extent of progression without a diagnostic scan.     Dr. ***** previously discussed with ***** and her daughter that there is reasonable concern for some progression given the new hypermetabolic bone metastases, and possibly some progression in the left lung. Ultimately she preferred  ***** therapy sotorasib over our ***** 101 clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy. She has overall tolerated therapy remarkably well with improved symptoms (lower oxygen requirement, improved dyspnea and resolved cough) with intervals scans 08/21/22 demonstrating partial response particularly in ***** mass-like lesion, both smaller and less avid. We note she appears to have grade 1 hepatotoxicity per 07/28/22 labs, although we do note have her most recent labwork from August available - close monitoring q3 weeks for LFT \"\nabnormalities should continue until her LFT's plateau and we discussed that we would ultimately hold therapy for grade 2 toxicities. We discussed we will continue therapy with interval scans q3 months.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Suspect stage ***** disease given bilateral lung involvement on scans, but no clear distant metastatic disease outside the chest, and right sided lung changes may in part be infection or inflammation rather than cancer. ***** NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 0%. Very symptomatic at diagnosis, requiring 4L supplemental oxygen now which is all new in setting of this diagnosis. And then was significantly deconditioned with ECOG PS 3 following several hospitalizations for cdiff/PNA/sepsis and associated bedrest. Fortunately she improved significantly with treatment of her infections and the initiation of chemotherapy. ECOG PS subsequently improved to ~1. Her April 2022 scans were concerning for progressive disease in the bones, and possibly also in the left lung s/p C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed. She was subsequently switched to sotorasib with most recent scans 08/21/22 demonstrating partial response. Moreover, she clinically feels well with improving cough, shortness of breath and oxygen requirement since initiating therapy.  - Continue Sotorasib 960 mg/day   - PET/CT from 08/21/22 with reported partial response, particularly with mass-like LLL consolidation smaller and less PET avid  - will continue to try to obtain the above imaging for review at *****  - follow up labs, last labs 07/28/22 with rising ALT. Discussed importance of CMP for monitoring of hepatotoxicity and will obtain most recent labs obtained 08/30/22 (see below)  - CT CAP with contrast in 3 months  - Recommendations discussed with Dr. *****  - Labs q3 weeks locally   - f/u with Dr. ***** following local scans    #grade 1 hepatoxicity  07/28/22 ALT ~106, asymptomatic.

The other option is the combination of adagrasib + ***** (*****-*****-MEK-***** inhibitor). However, she is not sure that travel to ***** ***** and forth would be feasible or desirable. And ultimately she actually thinks her quality of life right now remains excellent, and she is not sure that the additional side effects from going back on chemotherapy would outweigh the benefits. For now, she may accept some slow ongoing progression and plan to continue sotorasib a bit longer. At a minimum, would repeat scans again in 2-3 months. Ideally we would also repeat biopsy down the line to resend molecular testing to look for actionable resistance mechanisms and repeat PD-L1.    #Lung adenocarcinoma  Suspect stage ***** disease given bilateral lung involvement on scans. ***** NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 0%.

Imaging result in interval history above.   Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)                 09/24/23 1550  PETCT Limited Whole Body Vertex to Mid Thigh (Storage Only) Final result               Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with remote history of a RUL lung adenocarcinoma, treated initially back in 2009 for a ***** cancer with ***** with cisplatin/pemetrexed then downstaged to T2N0 and taken to surgery. Then many years late developed with increasing bilateral consolidations and diffuse groundglass, worst in the LLL, s/p several negative biopsies but ultimately found to have biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her recent lung biopsy here at *****. It took several procedures to come up with the diagnosis, but finally CT-guided biopsy did confirm cancer. I suspect this is a separate primary than her original lung cancer back in 2009. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma was suspected based on radiographic appearance, the path here is consistent with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ***** showed a ***** ***** mutation and PD-L1 was 0%.    \"\n  Based on bilateral lung involvement on PET/CT and CT scans, the patient appears to have stage ***** disease. No clear distant metastatic disease outside of the thorax, however, at diagnosis. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.      I previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. ***** ***** is an actionable mutation, with sotorasib and adagrasib approved as targeted therapy albeit technically approved in the 2L after chemotherapy +/- *****. Therefore, we started with carboplatin/pemetrexed alone (held off on immunotherapy initially given her recent infectious complications, deconditioning, and initially borderline performance status). She tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well overall in terms of symptoms and energy. Restaging scans on 12/22/2021 showed some areas of improvement/resolution (right lung and *****) but with persistent patchy consolidation in *****, some areas decreased and others potentially increased but confounded by post-obstructive changes. Also important to note that a month and a half elapsed from prior pre-treatment scan in September and when she actually started treatment in November. Therefore in the absence of clear evidence of progression we planned to continue. However there was initially some delay due to recurrent Cdiff+ and diarrhea, and then there was concern about a carboplatin reaction. She received one cycle of pemetrexed alone and then two additional cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. Restaging PET/CT scans on 04/27/2022; hard to say based on non-diagnostic CT scan the extent of progression. The bone findings do have CT correlates and do appear new. There has been improvement in ***** findings, possibly more uptake in consolidative LLL mass-like lesion, but hard to tell extent of progression without a diagnostic scan. \"\n    There enough concern for some progression given the new hypermetabolic bone metastases, and possibly some progression in the left lung. Ultimately she preferred ***** therapy SoC over our ***** 101 clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy, and she started sotorasib in 06/27/2022. She tolerated tx very well so far. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 showed slight interval progression in the bones and a single soft tissue lesion--but it's fairly subtle. PET/CT from 02/23/2023 showed improvement in bone and soft tissue disease consistent with ongoing response to sotorasib. She does have pain in L arm which corresponds to site of L acetabular bone metastasis; now s/p palliative RT here for pain control. PET/CT from 05/14/2023 showed a few places of increase in size and hypermetabolism (soft tissue implant posterior to R psoas and in L ischioanal fossa, along with ongoing hypermetabolism in L supra-acetabular lesion and L iliac wing lesion, possibly recurrent T3 met). She is s/p RT to the L acetabular and L iliac wing lesions, continuing on sotorasib. Today, we reviewed PET/CT from 09/24/2023. This scan does show some interval progression -- slight increase in ***** mass, along with increased size and hypermetabolism of several soft tissue metastases in the pelvis. Fairly incremental overall -- and she continues to feel well, albeit with some increased pain at sites of metastases.     We discussed a few options at this juncture given that it does appear her cancer continues to have slow progression. She has never had a checkpoint inhibitor, so I would favor an immunotherapy-based approach as next line treatment - either pembrolizumab alone or potentially ***** + docetaxel as per the PROLONG study (***** et al., 2020) or even potentially carboplatin, abraxane, pembrolizumab. Other options could include clinical trials. We discussed we have two potential trial options. The first is a ***** *****(ON) inhibitor from \"\n"},

Imaging result in interval history above.   Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)                 12/04/23 1429  PETCT Limited Whole Body Vertex to Mid Thigh (Storage Only) Final result               Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with remote history of a RUL lung adenocarcinoma, treated initially back in 2009 for a ***** cancer with ***** with cisplatin/pemetrexed then downstaged to T2N0 and taken to surgery. Then many years late developed with increasing bilateral consolidations and diffuse groundglass, worst in the LLL, s/p several negative biopsies but ultimately found to have biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her recent lung biopsy here at *****. It took several procedures to come up with the diagnosis, but finally CT-guided biopsy did confirm cancer. I suspect this is a \n separate primary than her original lung cancer back in 2009. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma was suspected based on radiographic appearance, the path here is consistent with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ***** showed a ***** ***** mutation and PD-L1 was 0%.      Based on bilateral lung involvement on PET/CT and CT scans, the patient appears to have stage ***** disease. No clear distant metastatic disease outside of the thorax, however, at diagnosis. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.      I previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. ***** ***** is an actionable mutation, with sotorasib and adagrasib approved as targeted therapy albeit technically approved in the 2L after chemotherapy +/- *****. Therefore, we started with carboplatin/pemetrexed alone (held off on immunotherapy initially given her recent infectious complications, deconditioning, and initially borderline performance status). She tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well overall in terms of symptoms and energy. Restaging scans on 12/22/2021 showed some areas of improvement/resolution (right lung and *****) but with persistent patchy consolidation in *****, some areas decreased and others potentially increased but confounded by post-obstructive changes. Also important to note that a month and a half elapsed from prior pre-treatment scan in September and when she actually started treatment in November. Therefore in the absence of clear evidence of progression we planned to continue. However there was initially some delay due to recurrent Cdiff+ and diarrhea, and then there was concern about a carboplatin reaction. She received one cycle of pemetrexed alone and then two additional cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. Restaging PET/CT scans on 04/27/2022; hard to say based on non-diagnostic CT scan the \n extent of progression. The bone findings do have CT correlates and do appear new. There has been improvement in ***** findings, possibly more uptake in consolidative LLL mass-like lesion, but hard to tell extent of progression without a diagnostic scan.     There enough concern for some progression given the new hypermetabolic bone metastases, and possibly some progression in the left lung. Ultimately she preferred ***** therapy SoC over our ***** 101 clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy, and she started sotorasib in 06/27/2022. She tolerated tx very well so far. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 showed slight interval progression in the bones and a single soft tissue lesion--but it's fairly subtle. PET/CT from 02/23/2023 showed improvement in bone and soft tissue disease consistent with ongoing response to sotorasib. She does have pain in L arm which corresponds to site of L acetabular bone metastasis; now s/p palliative RT here for pain control. PET/CT from 05/14/2023 showed a few places of increase in size and hypermetabolism (soft tissue implant posterior to R psoas and in L ischioanal fossa, along with ongoing hypermetabolism in L supra-acetabular lesion and L iliac wing lesion, possibly recurrent T3 met). She is s/p RT to the L acetabular and L iliac wing lesions, continuing on sotorasib. PET/CT from 09/24/2023 showed slight interval progression -- slight increase in ***** mass, along with increased size and hypermetabolism of several soft tissue metastases in the pelvis. Fairly incremental overall -- and she continues to feel well, albeit with some increased pain at sites of metastases. Today, we reviewed PET/CT from 12/04/2023 -- fairly stable overall, no clear progression.     We previously discussed a few options at this juncture given that it does appear her cancer may have recently had some slow progression. She has never had a checkpoint inhibitor, so I would favor an immunotherapy-based approach as \n next line treatment - either pembrolizumab alone or potentially ***** + docetaxel as per the PROLONG study (***** et al., 2020) or even potentially carboplatin, abraxane, pembrolizumab. Other options could include clinical trials. We discussed we have two potential trial options. We discussed trial of adagrasib + ***** (*****-*****-MEK-***** inhibitor). However, she is not sure that travel to ***** ***** and forth would be feasible or desirable. And ultimately she actually thinks her quality of life right now remains excellent, and she is not sure that the additional side effects from going back on chemotherapy would outweigh the benefits. For now, she may accept some slow ongoing progression and plan to continue sotorasib a bit longer. Plan to repeat PET/CT in early March once she returns from trip in February, or earlier if needed for new symptoms. Continue sotorasib in meantime. Ideally we would also repeat biopsy down the line to resend molecular testing to look for actionable resistance mechanisms and repeat PD-L1.    #Lung adenocarcinoma  Suspect stage ***** disease given bilateral lung involvement on scans. ***** NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 0%. Very symptomatic at diagnosis, requiring 4L supplemental oxygen. And then was significantly deconditioned with ECOG PS 3 following several hospitalizations for cdiff/PNA/sepsis and associated bedrest. Fortunately she improved significantly with treatment of her infections and the initiation of chemotherapy. ECOG PS subsequently improved to ~1. Her April 2022 scans were concerning for progressive disease in the bones, and possibly also in the left lung s/p C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed. She was subsequently switched to sotorasib. Scans in 08/21/22 demonstrated partial response. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 with interval PD in the bones and one soft tissue lesion, but subtle. PET/CT from 02/23/2023 stable to improved overall. PET/CT from 05/14/2023 with a few areas of likely \n progression (L ischioanal fossa, soft tissue implant near R psoas muscle, and a few bone metastases). She is s/p RT to L humerus and L ischiac wing and L acetabulum for pain and *****. PET/CT from 09/24/2023 with ongoing progression. Discussed a few options at this juncture including immunotherapy-based treatment (e.g. *****, alone or possibly with docetaxel) or a clinical trial as described below. She may ultimately continue sotorasib for a bit longer as she feels QoL right now better than it would be back on chemotherapy.     - Continue Sotorasib 960 mg/day for now given fairly incremental progression--she isn't sure she's willing to accept more side effects with a change in treatment, even though there has been slow and steady progression on sotorasib   - PET/CT from 08/21/22 with reported partial response, particularly with mass-like LLL consolidation smaller and less PET avid  - PET from 12/06/2022 shows some early progression in the bones; but she continues to feel great, better than on prior chemo regimen so discussed continuing a bit longer and getting a short interval PET in 2 months   - PET/CT from 02/23/2023 stable to improved   - PET/CT from 05/14/2023 with a few areas of *****: soft tissue implant posterior to R psoas, L ischioanal fossa, and several bone lesions including new uptake at T3  - s/p RT to L acetabular and L iliac wing mets for pain palliation, along with L humerus met in June 2023  - PET/CT 09/24/2023 with some ongoing progression in ***** and subcutaneous/soft tissue nodules in pelvis  - We discussed switching to ***** +/- docetaxel as SoC option vs clinical trial; but she isn't sure she wants chemotherapy and associated side effects -- and holding for now as of November 2023 given PET is stable   - Could do pembrolizumab alone as an alternative   - I did discuss we have a few trial options at ***** that she could also consider but she is not sure if she's willing/able to travel to \n \"*****    *****(ON) inhibitor - trial not open yet but may have availability later this year    Adagrasib + ***** - *****://*****.*****.*****/*****/*****  - Continue sotorasib for now until she feels ready to switch therapies --this is the plan for now  - PET/CT 12/04/2023 relatively stable   - Next scans in 3 months from prior scans  - Recommendations discussed with Dr. *****  - Ideally would consider repeat biopsy at the time of progression     #Bone metastases  We discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic.   - On Xgeva locally  - After one year of treatment, can switch to q3 months     #grade 1 hepatoxicity--resolved  07/28/22 ALT ~106, asymptomatic.

Imaging result in interval history above.   Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)      None               Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with remote history of a RUL lung adenocarcinoma, treated initially back in 2009 for a ***** cancer with ***** with \"\ncisplatin/pemetrexed then downstaged to T2N0 and taken to surgery. Then many years late developed with increasing bilateral consolidations and diffuse groundglass, worst in the LLL, s/p several negative biopsies but ultimately found to have biopsy-proven pulmonary adenocarcinoma, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her recent lung biopsy here at *****. It took several procedures to come up with the diagnosis, but finally CT-guided biopsy did confirm cancer. I suspect this is a separate primary than her original lung cancer back in 2009. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma was suspected based on radiographic appearance, the path here is consistent with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ***** showed a ***** ***** mutation and PD-L1 was 0%.      Based on bilateral lung involvement on PET/CT and CT scans, the patient appears to have stage ***** disease. No clear distant metastatic disease outside of the thorax, however, at diagnosis. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.      I previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. ***** ***** is an actionable mutation, with sotorasib and adagrasib approved as targeted therapy albeit technically approved in the 2L after chemotherapy +/- *****. Therefore, we started with carboplatin/pemetrexed alone (held off on immunotherapy initially given her recent infectious complications, deconditioning, and initially borderline performance status). She tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well overall in terms of symptoms and energy. Restaging scans on 12/22/2021 showed some areas of improvement/resolution (right lung and *****) but with persistent patchy consolidation in *****, some areas decreased and others potentially increased but \"\nconfounded by post-obstructive changes. Also important to note that a month and a half elapsed from prior pre-treatment scan in September and when she actually started treatment in November. Therefore in the absence of clear evidence of progression we planned to continue. However there was initially some delay due to recurrent Cdiff+ and diarrhea, and then there was concern about a carboplatin reaction. She received one cycle of pemetrexed alone and then two additional cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. Restaging PET/CT scans on 04/27/2022; hard to say based on non-diagnostic CT scan the extent of progression. The bone findings do have CT correlates and do appear new. There has been improvement in ***** findings, possibly more uptake in consolidative LLL mass-like lesion, but hard to tell extent of progression without a diagnostic scan.     There enough concern for some progression given the new hypermetabolic bone metastases, and possibly some progression in the left lung. Ultimately she preferred ***** therapy SoC over our ***** 101 clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy, and she started sotorasib in 06/27/2022. She tolerated tx very well so far. Only side effect is easy bruising. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 showed slight interval progression in the bones and a single soft tissue lesion--but it's fairly subtle. PET/CT from 02/23/2023 showed improvement in bone and soft tissue disease consistent with ongoing response to sotorasib. She does have pain in L arm which corresponds to site of L acetabular bone metastasis; now s/p palliative RT here for pain control. Today, we reviewed PET/CT from 05/14/2023 which shows a few places of increase in size and hypermetabolism (soft tissue implant posterior to R psoas and in L ischioanal fossa, along with ongoing hypermetabolism in L supra-acetabular lesion and L iliac wing lesion, possibly recurrent T3 met). She is s/p RT to the L acetabular and L iliac wing lesions, \"\ncontinuing on sotorasib. Next PET planned in 3 months from prior (around 08/13/2023). If these scans show ongoing progression, it may be time to consider switching systemic therapy. For now, continue sotorasib.     At that time of progression, she has never had a checkpoint inhibitor, so I would favor an immunotherapy-based approach as next line treatment - either pembrolizumab alone or potentially ***** + docetaxel as per the PROLONG study (***** et al., 2020). Other options could include clinical trials. We discussed we have two potential trial options. The first is a ***** *****(ON) inhibitor from ***** ***** (RMC-6291); this has the advantage of being a pill treatment if she wishes to avoid infusional treatment. The other option is the combination of adagrasib + ***** (*****-*****-MEK-***** inhibitor).     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Suspect stage ***** disease given bilateral lung involvement on scans. ***** NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 0%. Very symptomatic at diagnosis, requiring 4L supplemental oxygen. And then was significantly deconditioned with ECOG PS 3 following several hospitalizations for cdiff/PNA/sepsis and associated bedrest. Fortunately she improved significantly with treatment of her infections and the initiation of chemotherapy. ECOG PS subsequently improved to ~1. Her April 2022 scans were concerning for progressive disease in the bones, and possibly also in the left lung s/p C4 carboplatin/pemetrexed. She was subsequently switched to sotorasib. Scans in 08/21/22 demonstrated partial response. PET/CT from 12/06/2022 with interval PD in the bones and one soft tissue lesion, but subtle. PET/CT from 02/23/2023 stable to improved overall. PET/CT from 05/14/2023 with a few areas of likely progression (L ischioanal fossa, soft tissue implant near R psoas muscle, and a few bone metastases). She is s/p RT to L humerus and L ischiac wing and L acetabulum for pain and *****. She continues on \"\n"},

Imaging result in interval history above.     No recent imaging  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 7 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented \"\nfor the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment.      Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded very nicely. However complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. More recently he has been on a treatment break to let liver recover.      CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, we continued his treatment break. Repeat restaging scans from 05/19/2022 previously reviewed. MRI brain unfortunately shows new multifocal brain metastases. CT c/a/p otherwise fairly stable. He is now s/p GK to a total of 21 targets. Now here to discuss systemic therapy.     Given that his main site of progression is the CNS, highest utility will be an agent with CNS activity. Unfortunately he did not respond well to carboplatin/pemetrexed/*****-based approach in 1L, and other chemotherapy options (gemcitabine, docetaxel) will likely not have much activity in the brain and do not cross ***** barrier very well. I also ***** ***** ***** whether a trial of adagrasib could be considered. He will be at high risk for hepatotoxicity with adagrasib as there is some thought that this is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors particularly after immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, adagrasib does have CNS activity and he never had progression while on ***** inhibitor so it has some advantages \"\nover his other treatment options. I discussed options with ***** at length today and his preference is for adagrasib trial. We will plan to start adagrasib 200 mg BID on June 22 with weekly lab monitoring for LFTs. This is the lowest possible dose but *****-1 trial did have some patients at this dose who responded. Median time to onset of hepatotoxicity is 3 weeks so we should have a sense early on. We will also set up weekly provider visits to start and continue his weekly hydration appointments. Counseled at lengths about risks and he agrees to proceed.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with stable systemic disease  - However MRI brain from 05/19/2022 showed multiple new brain mets. Now s/p GK to 21 targets.  - Discussed some options for treatment including chemo (q2 week gemcitabine but not necessarily with good CNS activity vs pemetrexed but he had PD on this before) versus a trial of adagrasib (but reasonable risk of hepatotoxicity)  - Ultimately he prefers *****. We will move forward with lowest possible dose of adagrasib 200 mg BID, will need weekly labs for LFT monitoring to start and we will also arrange for weekly NP/MD provider visits as well to keep a very \"\nclose eye on him.  - Some concern that hepatotoxicity is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors, particularly after prior *****, discussed risks at length with him today and reviewed early signs/symptoms to watch for on treatment   - CT scans and brain MRI 6 weeks after starting therapy to assess initial response   - Continue weekly infusion center visits and labs  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider. Last option might be a ***** of pemetrexed monotherapy for CNS activity, although in the past he had minimal response to 2 cycles pemetrexed-based chemo.     #Brain mets  S/p GK to 21 targets on 06/02/2022. Given number of new lesions, I think a CNS active agent will be key and this contributed to our decision to move forward with adagrasib despite liver risks.     #Anemia  -Additional dose of feraheme given on June 11  -Hemoglobin improved now to 10.6   -He declines blood transfusions for religious reasons     Advance care planning  This patient has named a surrogate decision maker.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology consultation.     Previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of his lung biopsy pathology report. ***** testing revealed a ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 was 0%.        Then discussed staging. Based on the presence of a 2.7 cm RUL pulmonary nodule along with several bone metastases in left 6th rib, T8, and T10 (enlarging over time, FDG avid), the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. His case was discussed previously at thoracic tumor board, and the bone lesions were not felt to be amenable to biopsy but suspicion for metastases was high. Thoracic spine MRI confirmed bone metastases in the spine that in all likelihood are from his lung cancer.       Discussed treatment options. Noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. He has a ***** ***** mutation, but sotorasib is approved in the 2L only. We did have clinical trials of sotorasib-based regimens in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so we opted for standard treatment in 1L. Given low PD-L1 of 0%, we started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and pemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight loss, I empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for \"\nboth carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major issues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. We discussed that sotorasib is approved in the 2L treatment of ***** ***** mutated NSCLC and previously reviewed the data for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). Side effects can include transaminase elevations, myalgias, cytopenias, GI symptoms, rashes, edema, proteinuria, or rarely pneumonitis. We also discussed our clinical trial in the 2L setting of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy (***** 101).     In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" I felt he might benefit from the closer monitoring required by the trial. He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of clinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. We have several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety we both thought it best to discontinue study treatment. Instead, I have switched him to SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. We reviewed today the side effects from sotorasib including edema, LFT abnormalities, anemia, fatigue, arthralgias, dyspnea, pneumonitis, n/v, and diarrhea.     Finally, discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, he reports worsened pain \"\nat sites of known bone metastases (versus from right posterior lung primary; he is convinced that the pain is \"deeper\" and not in the bones). ***** with SMS and is now on oxycontin 10 mg q12H with oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain. I think a course of radiation could also be reasonable for pain control, can readdress depending on extent of initial response to systemic therapy. He also has lactulose prn for constipation. I think anemia is contributing to fatigue but he has expressed a desire to avoid blood transfusions for \"personal and religious reasons.\" I will start iron supplements to address component of iron deficiency anemia.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. Bone mets are not amenable to biopsy per prior TB discussion. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%. MRI T spine ordered to further evaluate bone lesions to help confirm stage; highly suggestive of metastases. So it does appear he has stage IV disease for which systemic therapy is the main treatment. He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. ***** transition to 2L treatment. He was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop \"\nstudy treatment. We will switch now to standard 2L sotorasib.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycle March 08 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021  - However now stopped study treatment for reasons above  - Now started on 2L sotorasib 960 mg/day; discussed at length today how to take this oral medication and the importance of taking it every day   - CT c/a/p in about 6 or 7 weeks from now to assess initial response to treatment 11/26/21  - ***** think palliative RT may be reasonable to help with pain control, but given how flustered he got with trial requirements for now will focus on systemic therapy  - Sotorasib monitoring: monitoring LFTs every 3 weeks for the first 3 months, then once a month. Monitor for signs/symptoms of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever). Monitor adherence.    #Bone mets  Bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic. So far we have held off on bone modifying agents but can continue to discuss after he follows up with dentist.   -***** does have a dentist, he will see them soon and ask about bisphosphate clearance  -Pain: oxycontin 20 mg q12H + oxycodone 5 mg prn, will pick up \"\ntoday  -RT would be reasonable as needed for palliation of painful bony *****.     #DVT  Acute DVT in bilateral gastrocnemius veins on lower extremity ultrasound on 08/07/2021. Due to confusion about dosing or rivaroxaban he briefly stopped and then developed more edema and repeat u/s with acute DVT bilaterally. He is now back on rivaroxaban 20 mg/day dose but has been taking it BID. I reviewed with him that he needs to take 20mg once daily.     #Prior hepatitis B  Positive hepatitis B core and surface antibody but negative surface antigen and negative DNA at prior checks, consistent with prior infection. He was started on entecavir for ppx while on chemotherapy and follow serial hepatitis B DNA levels.   - Entecavir 0.5 mg/day while on chemo  - Trend hepatitis B DNA levels    #Urinary frequency  -UA not suggestive of infection     #Low positive Hep C ab  Follow up Hep C RNA from 09/29/2021 was negative      #Supportive Care   - Connect with Dr. *****, PCP   - SW consult to help with psycho-social challenges, stress related to cancer diagnosis, resources for transportation (done)  - Prefers to be contacted via email if possible   - Bone pain: working with SMS, on oxycontin 10 mg q12H + oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn breakthrough   - Established care in ***** clinic, appreciate co-management   - Anemia: likely in part side effect of chemotherapy plus component of iron deficiency + chronic inflammation. ***** start iron 325 mg every other day for now.

History of Present Illness:  ***** is a ***** years old male with hx of moderate alcohol use, fatty liver disease, who diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma on 05/15/2021 with evidence of metastasis to bone s/p chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Patient is referred to hepatology clinic for worsening of LFT. He was first seen in hepatology clinic on 12/01/2021. This is a follow up visit.     He has history of chronic mild LFT elevation. The LFT in 2012 was mildly elevated with ***** 105, ALT 47, AST 89 with normal bilirubin. The LFT show some fluctuations in ***** ranging between 40-80 and ***** *****-***** with normal bilirubin. The etiology of elevated LFT was attributed to moderate to heavy alcohol use. The viral hepatitis were unremarkable except history of exposure to hepatitis B with core Ab positivity.  Liver imaging persistently showing increased echogenicity and hepatomegaly.    On 05/15/2021, he was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma confirmed by CT guided biopsy. There was also evidence of lytic lesion in ***** bodies c/w metastasis to bone. No evidence of metastasis to intra-abdominal organs, or to the brain. He was started on carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab on 07/16/2021. Further imaging showed progression of disease and increased in burden of metastasis. The treatment has stopped and he was consented for clinical trial using sotorasib and docetaxel. Patient decided to stop study treatment on 10/02/2021. He was started on only-sotorasib on 10/09/2021.     He did not show any change in ***** after initial round of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pembrolizumab. LFT on 08/05/2021 was T bili 0.3, Alk phos 142, AST 19, ALT 7. After short period of clinical trial treatment with Sotorasib and docetaxel on September 30-October 03, he started on Sotorasib monotherapy on 10/09/2021. The \"\nmultifocal bile duct injury. In  view of the temporal profile of elevation of liver enzymes following  reinstitution of sotorasib and improvement of liver enzyme  profile/bilirubin after drug cessation, the overall picture can be  compatible with drug-induced liver injury (*****). A mixed  hepatitic-cholestatic injury is common in *****. Other etiologies like  biliary obstruction, sepsis, ***** ***** etc. do not appear to be  relevant based on the clinical setting. The negative stains for EBV,  adenovirus and CMV do not support a viral etiology.       ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. male with a history of primary ***** adenocarcinoma, fatty liver disease in setting of moderate alcohol use started on sotorasib who developed transaminitis likely due to *****.    Abnormal liver tests due to *****: He showed significant acute liver injury with total bilirubin rising more than 30 in setting of resumption of *****. Liver biopsy from 01/29/22 showed hepatitis with multifocal bile duct injury. Abdominal imaging did not show any obstructive lesions. Given the temporal association of ***** ***** and improvement of LFT after stopping *****, the source of acute liver injury is most likely is ***** from *****.     We recommend to avoid ***** given the high risk of liver injury. It seems the liver injury is progressively improving. LFT can be monitored on monthly basis until normalized. The decision to start another type of immunotherapy is deferred to oncology team and based on goals of care discussions.     Hepatitis B exposure, He has core ab positive and negative surf Ag consistent with hepatitis B exposure. He has no evidence of cirrhosis. HBV recently rechecked which was negative. It would be reasonable to continue empiric Hep B prophylaxis with entecavir.       Fatty changes of liver, He has chronic fatty changes of liver along with mild LFT elevation prior to recent rise in *****. \"\nGiven the normal work up including autoimmune, viral and ***** and absence of risk factors for NAFLD, the most likely source of fatty change of liver is moderate alcohol use. Patient stopped drinking alcohol and is maintaining sobriety for at least 6 months. Patient counseled to maintain sobriety.    GB polyp, He has gallbladder poly of 1.8 cm based on the most recent US, but given the presence of metastatic disease, further surveillance is not indicated.     Hypoenhancing liver lesions, He has multiple small hypoenhancing liver lesions consistent with hemangioma. The most recent CT scan did not show any change in features of hepatic lesions since 2013.     Vaccination: He is immune against hepatitis B and A.     I advised him to abstain from alcohol use.    ATTESTATION:    My date of service is 05/20/2022. I was present for and performed key portions of the clinic visit. I am personally involved in the management of the patient. I agree with the findings and care plans as documented.     ***** ***** *****, MD        \"\nliver function test start to show significant change starting 11/16/2021 with rise in ***** up to 312, ALT 97, and AST 126. The LFT continued to rise with ***** 442, AST 257, and ALT 277.  Given the rise in *****, ***** put on hold on 11/27/2021.     Patient was evaluated in liver clinic and ***** was found as the most likely etiology of elevated LFT. After holding *****, the LFT on 12/04/2021 showed some improvement with ***** 315, ALT 146, AST 77. The LFT continues to improve with labs on 12/22/20212 as ***** 117, AST 19, ALT 26, and total ***** 0.4. ***** resumed at lower dose (half dose with 480 mg) on 12/23/2021. Follow up LFT on 12/25/2021 showed ALT 39, AST 31, ***** 117, total bilirubin 0.4. However, in mid January 2022, he noticed jaundice. Repeat LFT showed significant rise in ***** on 01/26/2022 with ALT 426, AST 342, ***** 1354, total bilirubin 34.8. He was admitted at *****. MRCP did not show any obstructive lesion. Subsequently, she underwent liver biopsy on 01/28/2022 showing nonspecific hepatitis with bile duct injury most consistent with drug induced liver injury. Subsequent, ***** stopped.     Since 01/25/2022, ***** has stopped. The LFT is progressively imrpoving. The most recent LFT on 03/19/2022 show total bilirubin 1.3, ***** 367, and AST 66 and ALT 50.  He has not started on any other chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimen yet.     Prior to starting clinical trial, he underwent work up for chronic liver disease including viral hepatitis with Hep C RNA not detected, Hep C Ab low positive, Hep B surf Ab 295, Hep B core Ab total positive, Hep B surf Ag negative, Hep B DNA not detected, HIV Ag/Ab negative. Also work up for autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease on November 2020 were negative with ***** negative, smooth muscle antibody negative, ANA titer 40, A1AT 129. The imaging on 11/26/2021 did not show any evidence of hepatic metastasis, no clear biliary ductal dilation and fatty liver changes. \"\nPunctate hypodensity in liver with no change compared to prior studies. He has never developed any acute hepatitis. He has never been on therapy for hepatitis B. He was given prescription for entecavir before starting chemotherapy. He has history of moderate to heavy alcohol use. He used to drink April 10 beer on most days. He usually drank more while watching soccer. He decreased the amount of drinking to March 08 drink and over the last 6 months he did not drink alcohol.     Since last visit on 03/18/2022, he is feeling weak and fatigue. He was found with brain metastasis and has been referred to radiation oncology. He has not started on any new chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimen. He denies any jaundice, lightheadedness, GI bleeding, mental fogginess, or abdominal distention.

Attention follow-up is recommended for hypodensity seen in the liver, but no change is seen between the current exam and the prior.    MRCP 01/27/2022  1. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  2. No suspicious hepatic masses with scattered hepatic cysts and hemangiomas which are stable dating back to 04/13/2012.  3. Pathologic T10 vertebral body fracture in the setting of osseous metastasis. Otherwise, no evidence of \"\nmetastatic disease in the abdomen.    CT Abdomen/Pelvis 11/26/2021 showed no convincing evidence of new metastases. Punctate hypodensity in segment 8 of liver is too small to characterize although similar compared to 09/09/2021, attention on follow-up. Decreased thickening and enhancement of bandlike soft tissue in the pelvis.     US Abdomen 11/26/2021 showed normal hepatic Dopplers. Unchanged hepatic hemangiomas. No sonographic findings to explain reported transaminitis. New 1.4 cm gallbladder polyp or less likely sludge.     CT Abdomen/Pelvis 09/09/2021 showed on the prior study dated 08/20/2021 new band like soft tissue was identified along the left mesorectum and extending to the presacral region and abutting the left seminal vesicle. This appearance is again identified with marked enhancement of the second tissue on this contrast-enhanced study. The appearance is more inflammatory than neoplastic. However the origin of the inflammation is not clearly identified. There is no definite communication to the rectum or evidence of fistula or diverticulitis. Inflammatory changes in the midline of the seminal vesicles are noted.    CT Abdomen/Pelvis 08/20/2021 showed compared to 05/05/2021, new bandlike soft tissue measuring approximately 4.4 x 1.0 cm extending along the left mesorectum to the presacral region and obliterating the fat plane with the left seminal vesicle. This would be an unusual appearance for metastasis, but tumor involvement is a consideration. If clinically warranted MR pelvis with contrast can be obtained.     CT Chest, Abdomen/Pelvis 05/05/2021 showed a solid hypermetabolic right upper lobe pulmonary nodule has mildly increased size compared to 04/01/2021 and is suspicious for primary pulmonary malignancy. Subcentimeter lytic lesions in the left posterolateral sixth rib, T8 vertebral body, and T10 vertebral body with hypermetabolism are indeterminate but raise suspicious for sites of metastatic disease \"\ngiven gradual enlargement since 2018. MRI of the thoracic spine could be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated. A high attenuation 1.1 cm lesion in the region of the third ventricle without hypermetabolism may represent a colloid cyst but is incompletely evaluated. Consider brain MRI for further characterization if clinically indicated.    CT Abdomen 04/01/2021 showed hepatic steatosis. Small cyst in right hepatic lobe. There are two hyperenhancing lesions in the right and left lobes as well as a hypodense lesion in the left lobe, previously characterized as hemangiomas on 04/13/2012 CT. No evidence of malignancy in the abdomen.    US Abdomen 03/19/2021 showed mild hepatic steatosis unchanged along with 3 known hepatic hemangiomas is characterized on CT from 0 April 2012.    US of abdomen on 11/22/2019  Liver: The liver span is 17.1 cm. Liver parenchyma is diffusely increased in echogenicity is similar to prior June 2017 exam. Again noted are 3 hypoechoic liver lesions, 2 in the left hepatic lobe measuring 1.0-1.4 cm and a third 1.6 cm lesion adjacent to the gallbladder fundus. These were previously shown to be hemangiomas on a April 2012 CT and are stable in size. Benign-appearing right hepatic lobe 8 mm cyst is again seen. Spleen: Measures 8.1 cm. Normal in size.    Cardiology  Chest ***** 09/11/2021 showed unchanged right upper lung opacity. No substantial pneumothorax. Unchanged mediastinal silhouette.     CT Chest 09/09/2021 showed compared to 08/20/2021, unchanged burden of metastatic disease in the chest unchanged dominant right upper lobe lesion and similar appearance of osseous lesions in the spine and ribs.    CT Chest 08/20/2021 showed compared to 05/05/2021, increased burden of metastatic disease in the chest as evidenced by increased size of masslike consolidation in the right upper lobe, newly enlarged 1.6 cm subcarinal lymph node, increased size of multiple lytic lesions in the spine and ribs as well as a a \"\nfew new lytic osseous lesions. Of note, there is a small amount of osseous destruction along the posterior aspect of the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies without definite evidence of spinal canal invasion, however recommend correlation with neurologic exam. A slowly enlarging 1.7 cm cystic lesion in the left upper lobe is suspicious metachronous adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesion.    Chest ***** 05/15/2021 showed no pneumothorax.    CT Chest Biopsy 05/15/2021 showed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Consolidated lung parenchyma with invasive adenocarcinoma. The tumor shows acinar, and cribriform architecture. The tumor cells are moderately pleomorphic and contain occasional mucinous vacuoles. Several mitoses are identified.     CT Chest 04/01/2021 showed right upper lobe mass measuring up to 2.5 cm, concerning for malignancy. Clustered tree-in-bud nodules in the right lower lobe and scattered calcified biapical nodules, likely reflecting chronic infection or sequela thereof.    Endoscopy  EGD 03/16/2021 showed the entire examined duodenum appeared normal. There was mild antral gastropathy noted with no significant pathologic abnormality. The mucosa of the esophagus appeared normal.     Colonoscopy 03/16/2021 showed mild non-bleeding diverticulosis in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. Five sessile polyps ranging from 6 to 12mm in size were found in the ascending colon and transverse colon; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Two sessile polyps ranging from 4 to 6mm in size were found in the sigmoid colon and rectum; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Retroflexed views revealed internal hemorrhoids. Prep was poor.  No very large polyp or mass, however, and no cause for weight loss found. Right colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma and tubulovillous adenoma. Left colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma.     Pathology  Liver biopsy on 01/29/2022  The liver biopsy shows hepatitis with \"\n"},

He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded; however complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. Now on treatment break to let liver recover.     Today, we reviewed CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging; overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear \"\nprogression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, I would favor continuing the treatment break. Repeat CT scans in about 8 weeks (late May). Follow up in clinic in 4 weeks to check in about symptoms. At the time of progression, could consider other gentle chemotherapy.     He has been set up with weekly hydration in infusion center and weekly lab monitoring. We can start spacing this out to every 2 week infusions and labs every 4 weeks.  We had also ordered home health/home PT to help with recovery, but today he tells me they haven't been coming. I will ask my clinic staff to follow up on the status. Finally, discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, he is overall improving today while on treatment break. He reports his energy and appetite have improved (walking almost daily April 09 blocks, basic grocery shopping), and that his pain is well-controlled (f/b SMS). Anemia now improved with iron supplementation.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology consultation.     Previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of his lung biopsy pathology report. ***** testing revealed a ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 was 0%.        Then discussed staging. Based on the presence of a 2.7 cm RUL pulmonary nodule along with several bone metastases in left 6th rib, T8, and T10 (enlarging over time, FDG avid), the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. His case was discussed previously at thoracic tumor board, and the bone lesions were not felt to be amenable to biopsy but suspicion for metastases was high. Thoracic spine MRI confirmed bone metastases in the spine that in all likelihood are from his lung cancer.       Discussed treatment options. Noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. He has a ***** ***** mutation, but sotorasib is approved in the 2L only. We did have clinical trials of sotorasib-based regimens in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so we opted for standard treatment in 1L. Given low PD-L1 of 0%, we started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and \"\npemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight loss, I empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for both carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major issues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. We discussed that sotorasib is approved in the 2L treatment of ***** ***** mutated NSCLC and previously reviewed the data for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). Side effects can include transaminase elevations, myalgias, cytopenias, GI symptoms, rashes, edema, proteinuria, or rarely pneumonitis. We also discussed our clinical trial in the 2L setting of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy (***** 101).     In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" I felt he might benefit from the closer monitoring required by the trial. He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of clinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. We have several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety we both thought it best to discontinue study treatment.    I then switched him \"\nto SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. First restaging CT scans from 11/26/2021 show a very nice response to treatment. Unfortunately, however, we have had to hold sotorasib due to new ***** LFT abnormalities (elevated AST, ALT, and alk phos; bili wnl still). Given that labs still ***** despite holding treatment for 10 days, I have also referred him to hepatology for further work up and management. Suspect this is sotorasib-induced liver injury but appreciate hepatology input.     Finally, discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, bone pain is now improved. ***** with SMS and is now on oxycontin 10 mg q12H with oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain. He also has lactulose prn for constipation. I think anemia is contributing to fatigue but he has expressed a desire to avoid blood transfusions for \"personal and religious reasons.\" I will start iron supplements to address component of iron deficiency anemia.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study \"\ntreatment. Switched now to standard 2L sotorasib.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021  - However now stopped study treatment for reasons above  - 2L sotorasib 960 mg/day now on hold for grade 3 transaminase elevations, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib   - ***** sotorasib until labs improve to <= grade 1 or baseline, and then consider resuming at one dose level reduction (480 mg/day)   - Next CT scans in about 3 months (late February), will order at subsequent visit   - Sotorasib monitoring: monitoring LFTs every 3 weeks for the first 3 months, then once a month. Monitor for signs/symptoms of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever). Monitor adherence.    #Bone mets  Bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No recent imaging  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 7 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the \"\npoint where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment.      Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded very nicely. However complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. More recently he has been on a treatment break to let liver recover.      CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, we continued his treatment break. Repeat restaging scans from 05/19/2022 previously reviewed. MRI brain unfortunately shows new multifocal brain metastases. CT c/a/p otherwise fairly stable. He is now s/p GK to a total of 21 targets. Now here for follow up.     Given that his main site of progression is the CNS, highest utility will be an agent with CNS activity. Unfortunately he did not respond well to carboplatin/pemetrexed/*****-based approach in 1L, and other chemotherapy options (gemcitabine, docetaxel) will likely not have much activity in the brain and do not cross ***** barrier very well. I also ***** ***** ***** whether a trial of adagrasib could be considered. He will be at high risk for hepatotoxicity with adagrasib as there is some thought that this is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors particularly after immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, adagrasib does have CNS activity and he never had progression while on ***** inhibitor so it has some advantages over his other treatment options. I discussed options with ***** at length today and his preference is for adagrasib trial. Started adagrasib 200 mg BID on June 22 with weekly lab monitoring for LFTs. This is the lowest possible dose but \"\n*****-1 trial did have some patients at this dose who responded. Median time to onset of hepatotoxicity is 3 weeks so we should have a sense early on. We will also set up weekly provider visits to start and continue his weekly hydration appointments. Counseled at lengths about risks and he agrees to proceed.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with stable systemic disease  - However MRI brain from 05/19/2022 showed multiple new brain mets. Now s/p GK to 21 targets.  - Discussed some options for treatment including chemo (q2 week gemcitabine but not necessarily with good CNS activity vs pemetrexed but he had PD on this before) versus a trial of adagrasib (but reasonable risk of hepatotoxicity)  - Ultimately he prefers *****. Started on lowest possible dose of adagrasib 200 mg BID, will need weekly labs for LFT monitoring to start and we will also arrange for weekly NP/MD provider visits as well to keep a very close eye on him. So far he is tolerating it well.   - Some concern that hepatotoxicity is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors, particularly after prior *****, discussed risks at length with him today and reviewed early signs/symptoms to watch for on \"\ntreatment   - CT scans and brain MRI 6 weeks after starting therapy to assess initial response; MRI brain scheduled 08/03/2022 and CT c/a/p scheduled 08/13/2022  - Continue weekly infusion center visits and labs  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider. Last option might be a ***** of pemetrexed monotherapy for CNS activity, although in the past he had minimal response to 2 cycles pemetrexed-based chemo.     #Brain mets  S/p GK to 21 targets on 06/02/2022. Given number of new lesions, I think a CNS active agent will be key and this contributed to our decision to move forward with adagrasib despite liver risks. Repeat MRI planned 08/13/2022.     #Anemia  -Additional dose of feraheme given on June 11  -Hemoglobin improved now to 10.6   -He declines blood transfusions for religious reasons     #Constipation  -Continue colace/senna     Advance care planning  This patient has named a surrogate decision maker.

I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic.

Of note, there is a small amount of osseous destruction along the posterior aspect of the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies without definite evidence of spinal canal invasion, however recommend correlation with neurologic exam. A slowly enlarging 1.7 cm cystic lesion in the left upper lobe is suspicious metachronous adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesion. Compared to 05/05/2021, new bandlike soft tissue measuring approximately 4.4 x \"\n1.0 cm extending along the left mesorectum to the presacral region and obliterating the fat plane with the left seminal vesicle.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No recent imaging  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 7 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology consultation.     Previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of his lung biopsy pathology report. ***** testing revealed a ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 was 0%. Based on the presence of a 2.7 cm RUL pulmonary nodule along with several bone metastases in left 6th rib, T8, and T10 (enlarging over time, FDG avid), the patient has stage IV disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in \"\nlength and quality of life if it responds to treatment. His case was discussed previously at thoracic tumor board, and the bone lesions were not felt to be amenable to biopsy but suspicion for metastases was high. Thoracic spine MRI confirmed bone metastases in the spine that in all likelihood are from his lung cancer.       The standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. He has a ***** ***** mutation, but sotorasib is approved in the 2L only. ***** trials of sotorasib-based regimens existed in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so he opted for standard treatment in 1L. Given low PD-L1 of 0%, he started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and pemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight loss, Dr. ***** empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for both carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major issues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. Dr. ***** discussed that sotorasib is approved in the 2L treatment of ***** ***** mutated NSCLC and previously reviewed the data for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). Side effects can include \"\ntransaminase elevations, myalgias, cytopenias, GI symptoms, rashes, edema, proteinuria, or rarely pneumonitis. Dr ***** also discussed our clinical trial in the 2L setting of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy (***** 101).     In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" Dr. ***** felt he might benefit from the closer monitoring required by the trial. He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of clinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. Dr. ***** had several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety we both thought it best to discontinue study treatment.    Dr. ***** then switched him to SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. First restaging CT scans from 11/26/2021 show a very nice response to treatment. Unfortunately, however, we had to hold sotorasib due to new ***** LFT abnormalities (elevated AST, ALT, and alk phos; bili wnl still). He was evaluated by hepatology and sotorasib was felt to be the most likely cause of his transaminitis. After improvement back down to normal range, we restarted on sotorasib at half dose (480 mg/day) with close monitoring of LFTs    Unfortunately he then developed a profound hyperbilirubinemia with Tbili peak at 32 on routine labs prompting a hospital admission for workup. He underwent a liver biopsy which showed biliary ductal inflammation most consistent with drug induced liver injury, and other workup for acute liver injury including viral & obstructive causes were normal. Sotorasib was discontinued upon hospital admission and his bilirubin is now downtrending, albeit still high at ~6.    Plan to stop sotorasib indefinitely given high suspicion that it directly contribute to significant liver injury and given current \"\nclinical status will go on a treatment break for ~6 weeks (until ~03/30/22) to allow him time to recover. He has been set up with home health/home PT set up to help with recovery as well as weekly hydration in infusion center and weekly lab monitoring. ***** plan for repeat staging scans in 6 weeks (late March) and a discussion thereafter about next line therapies- likely chemotherapy such as gemcitabine. With pt's permission, we will also update his siblings directly.     Finally, discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, he is overall improving today while on treatment break. He reports his energy and appetite have improved (walking almost daily April 09 blocks, basic grocery shopping), and that his pain is well-controlled (f/b SMS). Anemia may be contributing to fatigue but he has expressed a desire to avoid blood transfusions for \"personal and religious reasons.\"  ***** with Dr. ***** who follows him for monocytosis to get him set up for iron infusions.    #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in \"\n"},

Imaging result in interval history above.     No recent imaging  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 7 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology consultation.     Previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of his lung biopsy pathology report. ***** testing revealed a ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 was 0%. Based on the presence of a 2.7 cm RUL pulmonary nodule along with several bone metastases in left 6th rib, T8, and T10 (enlarging over time, FDG avid), the patient has stage IV disease. Stage IV disease is \"\nconsidered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. His case was discussed previously at thoracic tumor board, and the bone lesions were not felt to be amenable to biopsy but suspicion for metastases was high. Thoracic spine MRI confirmed bone metastases in the spine that in all likelihood are from his lung cancer.       The standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. He has a ***** ***** mutation, but sotorasib is approved in the 2L only. ***** trials of sotorasib-based regimens existed in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so he opted for standard treatment in 1L. Given low PD-L1 of 0%, he started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and pemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight loss, Dr. ***** empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for both carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major issues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of \"\nclinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. We had several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety we both thought it best to discontinue study treatment.    We then switched him to SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. First restaging CT scans from 11/26/2021 show a very nice response to treatment. Unfortunately, however, we had to hold sotorasib due to new ***** LFT abnormalities (elevated AST, ALT, and alk phos; bili wnl still). He was evaluated by hepatology and sotorasib was felt to be the most likely cause of his transaminitis. After improvement back down to normal range, we restarted on sotorasib at half dose (480 mg/day) with close monitoring of LFTs. Unfortunately he then developed a profound hyperbilirubinemia with Tbili peak at 32 on routine labs prompting a hospital admission for workup. He underwent a liver biopsy which showed biliary ductal inflammation most consistent with drug induced liver injury, and other workup for acute liver injury including viral & obstructive causes were normal. Sotorasib was discontinued upon hospital admission and his bilirubin is now downtrending close to normal range.    We have stopped sotorasib indefinitely given high suspicion that it directly contribute to significant liver injury. He is on a treatment break for ~6 weeks to allow him time to recover. Scans planned on 04/02/2022 for restaging. We will plan discussion thereafter about next line therapies- likely gentle chemotherapy such as weekly gemcitabine. With pt's permission, we will also update his siblings directly.     He has been set up with weekly hydration in infusion center and weekly lab monitoring. We had also ordered home health/home PT to help with recovery, but today he tells me they haven't been coming. I will ask my clinic staff to follow up on the status. Finally, discussed supportive care. In \"\nterms of symptoms, he is overall improving today while on treatment break. He reports his energy and appetite have improved (walking almost daily April 09 blocks, basic grocery shopping), and that his pain is well-controlled (f/b SMS). Anemia now improved with iron supplementation.     #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib however complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely.    - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib 960 mg/day, most \"\n"},

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic \"\nmedical oncology consultation.     We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of his lung biopsy pathology report. ***** testing revealed a ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 was 0%.        We then discussed staging. Based on the presence of a 2.7 cm RUL pulmonary nodule along with several bone metastases in left 6th rib, T8, and T10 (enlarging over time, FDG avid), the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. His case was discussed previously at thoracic tumor board, and the bone lesions were not felt to be amenable to biopsy but suspicion for metastases was high. Thoracic spine MRI confirmed bone metastases in the spine that in all likelihood are from his lung cancer.       We then discussed treatment options. I noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. He has a ***** ***** mutation, but sotorasib is approved in the 2L only. We did have clinical trials of sotorasib-based regimens in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so we opted for standard treatment in 1L. Given low PD-L1 of 0%, we started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and pemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight loss, I empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for both carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major \"\nissues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. We discussed that sotorasib is approved in the 2L treatment of ***** ***** mutated NSCLC and previously reviewed the data for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). Side effects can include transaminase elevations, myalgias, cytopenias, GI symptoms, rashes, edema, proteinuria, or rarely pneumonitis. We also discussed our clinical trial in the 2L setting of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy (***** 101).     In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" I felt he might benefit from the closer monitoring required by the trial. He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of clinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. We have several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety we both thought it best to discontinue study treatment. Instead, I have switched him to SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. We reviewed today the side effects from sotorasib including edema, LFT abnormalities, anemia, fatigue, arthralgias, dyspnea, pneumonitis, n/v, and diarrhea.     Finally, we discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, he reports worsened pain at sites of known bone metastases (versus from right posterior lung primary; he is convinced that the pain is \"deeper\" and not in the bones). ***** with SMS and is now on oxycontin 10 mg q12H with oxycodone 5 mg for \"\nbreakthrough pain. I think a course of radiation could also be reasonable for pain control, can readdress depending on extent of initial response to systemic therapy. He also has lactulose prn for constipation. I think anemia is contributing to fatigue but he has expressed a desire to avoid blood transfusions for \"personal and religious reasons.\" I will start iron supplements to address component of iron deficiency anemia.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. Bone mets are not amenable to biopsy per prior TB discussion. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%. MRI T spine ordered to further evaluate bone lesions to help confirm stage; highly suggestive of metastases. So it does appear he has stage IV disease for which systemic therapy is the main treatment. He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. ***** transition to 2L treatment. He was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. We will switch now to standard 2L sotorasib.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycle March 08 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2) \"\n  - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021  - However now stopped study treatment for reasons above  - Now started on 2L sotorasib 960 mg/day; discussed at length today how to take this oral medication and the importance of taking it every day   - CT c/a/p in about 6 or 7 weeks from now to assess initial response to treatment  - I think palliative RT may be reasonable to help with pain control, but given how flustered he got with trial requirements for now will focus on systemic therapy  - Sotorasib monitoring: monitoring LFTs every 3 weeks for the first 3 months, then once a month. Monitor for signs/symptoms of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever). Monitor adherence.    #Bone mets  Bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic. So far we have held off on bone modifying agents but can continue to discuss after he follows up with dentist.   -***** does have a dentist, he will see them soon and ask about bisphosphate clearance  -Pain: oxycontin 10 mg q12H + oxycodone 5 mg prn, now better controlled   -RT would be reasonable as needed for palliation of painful bony *****.     #DVT  Acute DVT in bilateral gastrocnemius veins on lower extremity ultrasound on 08/07/2021. Due to confusion about dosing or rivaroxaban \"\nhe briefly stopped and then developed more edema and repeat u/s with acute DVT bilaterally. He is now back on rivaroxaban 15 mg BID x3 weeks, followed by 20 mg/day dose. I reviewed with him that switch should occur on Friday.      #Prior hepatitis B  Positive hepatitis B core and surface antibody but negative surface antigen and negative DNA at prior checks, consistent with prior infection. He was started on entecavir for ppx while on chemotherapy and follow serial hepatitis B DNA levels.   - Entecavir 0.5 mg/day while on chemo  - Trend hepatitis B DNA levels    #Urinary frequency  -UA not suggestive of infection     #Low positive Hep C ab  Follow up Hep C RNA from 09/29/2021 was negative      #Supportive Care   - Connect with Dr. *****, PCP   - SW consult to help with psycho-social challenges, stress related to cancer diagnosis, resources for transportation (done)  - Prefers to be contacted via email if possible   - Bone pain: working with SMS, on oxycontin 10 mg q12H + oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn breakthrough   - Established care in ***** clinic, appreciate co-management   - Anemia: likely in part side effect of chemotherapy plus component of iron deficiency + chronic inflammation. ***** start iron 325 mg every other day for now.

Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    History of Present Illness:  ***** is a ***** years old male with hx of moderate alcohol use, fatty liver disease, who diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma on 05/15/2021 with evidence of metastasis to bone s/p chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Patient is referred to hepatology clinic for worsening of LFT.     He has history of chronic mild LFT elevation. The LFT in 2012 show ***** 105, ALT 47, AST 89 with normal bilirubin. The LFT show some fluctuations in ***** ranging between 40-80 and ***** *****-***** with normal bilirubin. The etiology of elevated LFT was attributed to moderate to heavy alcohol use. The viral hepatitis were unremarkable except history of exposure to hepatitis B with core Ab positivity.  Liver imaging persistently showing increased echogenicity and hepatomegaly.    On 05/15/2021, he was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma confirmed by CT guided biopsy. There was also evidence of lytic lesion in ***** bodies c/w metastasis to bone. No evidence of metastasis to intra-abdominal organs, or to the brain. He was started on carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab on 07/16/2021. Further imaging showed progression of disease and increased in burden of metastasis. The treatment has stopped and he was consented for clinical trial using sotorasib and docetaxel. Patient decided to stop study treatment on 10/02/2021. He was started on only sotorasib on 10/09/2021.     He did not show any change in ***** after diagnosis of LFT or after \"\nthe presence of metastatic disease, further surveillance is not indicated.     Hypoenhancing liver lesions, He has multiple small hypoenhancing liver lesions consistent with hemangioma. The most recent CT scan did not show any change in features of hepatic lesions since 2013.     Vaccination: He is immune against hepatitis B and A.     I advised him to abstain from alcohol use.    ATTESTATION:    My date of service is 12/01/2021. I was present for and performed key portions of the video visit. I am personally involved in the management of the patient. I agree with the findings and care plans as documented.     I spent a total of 90 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.

LFT on 08/05/2021 show T bili 0.3, Alk phos 142, AST 19, ALT 7. After short period of clinical trial treatment with Sotorasib and docetaxel on September 30-October 03, he started on Sotorasib monotherapy since 10/09/2021. The labs 3 weeks after Sotorasib therapy show no ***** change compared to baseline with T bili 0.4, Alk phos 158, AST 39, ALT 20. The liver function test start to show significant change starting 11/16/2021 with rise in ***** up to 312, ALT 97, and AST 126. The LFT continued to rise with ***** 442, AST 257, and ALT 277.  Given the rise in *****, ***** is on hold since 11/27/2021.     Prior starting clinical trial, he underwent work up for chronic liver disease including viral hepatitis with Hep C RNA not detected, Hep C Ab low positive, Hep B surf Ab 295, Hep B core Ab total positive, Hep B surf Ag negative, Hep B DNA not detected, HIV Ag/Ab negative. Also work up for autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease on November 2020 were negative with ***** negative, smooth muscle antibody negative, ANA titer 40, A1AT 129. The imaging on 11/26/2021 show no evidence of hepatic metastasis, no clear biliary ductal dilation and fatty liver changes. Punctate hypodensity in liver with no change compared to prior studies. He has never developed any acute hepatitis. He has never been on therapy for hepatitis B. He was given prescription for entecavir before starting chemotherapy, but he has not started it yet.

Punctate hypodensity in segment 8 of liver is too small to characterize although similar compared to 09/09/2021, attention on follow-up. Decreased thickening and enhancement of bandlike soft tissue in the pelvis.     US Abdomen 11/26/2021 showed normal hepatic Dopplers. Unchanged hepatic hemangiomas. No sonographic findings to explain reported transaminitis. New 1.4 cm \"\ngallbladder polyp or less likely sludge.     CT Abdomen/Pelvis 09/09/2021 showed on the prior study dated 08/20/2021 new band like soft tissue was identified along the left mesorectum and extending to the presacral region and abutting the left seminal vesicle. This appearance is again identified with marked enhancement of the second tissue on this contrast-enhanced study. The appearance is more inflammatory than neoplastic. However the origin of the inflammation is not clearly identified. There is no definite communication to the rectum or evidence of fistula or diverticulitis. Inflammatory changes in the midline of the seminal vesicles are noted.    CT Abdomen/Pelvis 08/20/2021 showed compared to 05/05/2021, new bandlike soft tissue measuring approximately 4.4 x 1.0 cm extending along the left mesorectum to the presacral region and obliterating the fat plane with the left seminal vesicle. This would be an unusual appearance for metastasis, but tumor involvement is a consideration. If clinically warranted MR pelvis with contrast can be obtained.     CT Chest, Abdomen/Pelvis 05/05/2021 showed a solid hypermetabolic right upper lobe pulmonary nodule has mildly increased size compared to 04/01/2021 and is suspicious for primary pulmonary malignancy. Subcentimeter lytic lesions in the left posterolateral sixth rib, T8 vertebral body, and T10 vertebral body with hypermetabolism are indeterminate but raise suspicious for sites of metastatic disease given gradual enlargement since 2018. MRI of the thoracic spine could be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated. A high attenuation 1.1 cm lesion in the region of the third ventricle without hypermetabolism may represent a colloid cyst but is incompletely evaluated. Consider brain MRI for further characterization if clinically indicated.    CT Abdomen 04/01/2021 showed hepatic steatosis. Small cyst in right hepatic lobe. There are two hyperenhancing lesions in the \"\nright and left lobes as well as a hypodense lesion in the left lobe, previously characterized as hemangiomas on 04/13/2012 CT. No evidence of malignancy in the abdomen.    US Abdomen 03/19/2021 showed mild hepatic steatosis unchanged along with 3 known hepatic hemangiomas is characterized on CT from 0 April 2012.    US of abdomen on 11/22/2019  Liver: The liver span is 17.1 cm. Liver parenchyma is diffusely increased in echogenicity is similar to prior June 2017 exam. Again noted are 3 hypoechoic liver lesions, 2 in the left hepatic lobe measuring 1.0-1.4 cm and a third 1.6 cm lesion adjacent to the gallbladder fundus. These were previously shown to be hemangiomas on a April 2012 CT and are stable in size. Benign-appearing right hepatic lobe 8 mm cyst is again seen. Spleen: Measures 8.1 cm. Normal in size.    Cardiology  Chest ***** 09/11/2021 showed unchanged right upper lung opacity. No substantial pneumothorax. Unchanged mediastinal silhouette.     CT Chest 09/09/2021 showed compared to 08/20/2021, unchanged burden of metastatic disease in the chest unchanged dominant right upper lobe lesion and similar appearance of osseous lesions in the spine and ribs.    CT Chest 08/20/2021 showed compared to 05/05/2021, increased burden of metastatic disease in the chest as evidenced by increased size of masslike consolidation in the right upper lobe, newly enlarged 1.6 cm subcarinal lymph node, increased size of multiple lytic lesions in the spine and ribs as well as a a few new lytic osseous lesions. Of note, there is a small amount of osseous destruction along the posterior aspect of the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies without definite evidence of spinal canal invasion, however recommend correlation with neurologic exam. A slowly enlarging 1.7 cm cystic lesion in the left upper lobe is suspicious metachronous adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesion.    Chest ***** 05/15/2021 showed no pneumothorax.    CT Chest Biopsy 05/15/2021 showed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. \"\nConsolidated lung parenchyma with invasive adenocarcinoma. The tumor shows acinar, and cribriform architecture. The tumor cells are moderately pleomorphic and contain occasional mucinous vacuoles. Several mitoses are identified.     CT Chest 04/01/2021 showed right upper lobe mass measuring up to 2.5 cm, concerning for malignancy. Clustered tree-in-bud nodules in the right lower lobe and scattered calcified biapical nodules, likely reflecting chronic infection or sequela thereof.    Endoscopy  EGD 03/16/2021 showed the entire examined duodenum appeared normal. There was mild antral gastropathy noted with no significant pathologic abnormality. The mucosa of the esophagus appeared normal.     Colonoscopy 03/16/2021 showed mild non-bleeding diverticulosis in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. Five sessile polyps ranging from 6 to 12mm in size were found in the ascending colon and transverse colon; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Two sessile polyps ranging from 4 to 6mm in size were found in the sigmoid colon and rectum; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Retroflexed views revealed internal hemorrhoids. Prep was poor.  No very large polyp or mass, however, and no cause for weight loss found. Right colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma and tubulovillous adenoma. Left colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma.          ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. male with a history of primary ***** adenocarcinoma, fatty liver disease in setting of moderate alcohol use started on sotorasib who developed transaminitis.    Abnormal liver tests: She has chronic mild rise in ***** and AST likely in setting of moderate alcohol use. Since 11/16/2021, she was found with progressive rise in ***** with ***** going up to 42, AST 257, ALT 277 and normal bilirubin. He was started on Sotorasib about 6 weeks before discovery of rise in *****. Given the temporal association, ***** \"\ninduced liver injury due to Sotorasib is the most likely DDx. The other differential diagnosis is hepatitis in setting of pembrolizumab use in August 2021 which is immune check point inhibitor. This is less likely given the temporal association which is more consistent with toxicity from *****. While it is less likely, hepatitis B flare up is potential DDx.    For management of Sotorasib induced liver injury, we recommend to hold medication until the LFT is improving down to 2-3 times upper limit of normal. If the LFT is not improving we can consider trial of corticosteroid versus liver biopsy to confirm the etiology. Sotorasib is ***** inhibitor with reported 20-30% risk of liver injury. As Sotorasib is not checkpoint inhibitor, treatment with steroid is not the first option. It is prudent to check for Hepatitis B DNA to rule out hep B flare up as the source of LFT elevation. For completion of work up, we also check for CMV and EBV. We monitor the LFT closely and if the LFT is not improving while holding Sotorasib, we rediscuss the need for liver biopsy.    Hepatitis B exposure, He has core ab positive and negative surf Ag consistent with hepatitis B exposure. He has no evidence of cirrhosis. HBV checked on September 2021 which was negative. It would be reasonable to monitor HBV DNA every 3 months while on chemotherapy if restarted though another option would be to start ***** Hep B prophylaxis with entecavir.       Fatty changes of liver, He has chronic fatty changes of liver along with mild LFT elevation prior to recent rise in *****. Given the normal work up including autoimmune, viral and ***** and absence of risk factors for NAFLD, the most likely source of fatty change of liver is moderate alcohol use. Patient stopped drinking alcohol and is maintaining sobriety for at least 4 months. Patient counseled to maintain sobriety.    GB polyp, He has gallbladder poly of 1.8 cm based on the most recent US, but given \"\n"},

Punctate hypodensity in segment 8 of liver is too small to characterize although similar \"\ncompared to 09/09/2021, attention on follow-up. Decreased thickening and enhancement of bandlike soft tissue in the pelvis.     US Abdomen 11/26/2021 showed normal hepatic Dopplers. Unchanged hepatic hemangiomas. No sonographic findings to explain reported transaminitis. New 1.4 cm gallbladder polyp or less likely sludge.     CT Abdomen/Pelvis 09/09/2021 showed on the prior study dated 08/20/2021 new band like soft tissue was identified along the left mesorectum and extending to the presacral region and abutting the left seminal vesicle. This appearance is again identified with marked enhancement of the second tissue on this contrast-enhanced study. The appearance is more inflammatory than neoplastic. However the origin of the inflammation is not clearly identified. There is no definite communication to the rectum or evidence of fistula or diverticulitis. Inflammatory changes in the midline of the seminal vesicles are noted.    CT Abdomen/Pelvis 08/20/2021 showed compared to 05/05/2021, new bandlike soft tissue measuring approximately 4.4 x 1.0 cm extending along the left mesorectum to the presacral region and obliterating the fat plane with the left seminal vesicle. This would be an unusual appearance for metastasis, but tumor involvement is a consideration. If clinically warranted MR pelvis with contrast can be obtained.     CT Chest, Abdomen/Pelvis 05/05/2021 showed a solid hypermetabolic right upper lobe pulmonary nodule has mildly increased size compared to 04/01/2021 and is suspicious for primary pulmonary malignancy. Subcentimeter lytic lesions in the left posterolateral sixth rib, T8 vertebral body, and T10 vertebral body with hypermetabolism are indeterminate but raise suspicious for sites of metastatic disease given gradual enlargement since 2018. MRI of the thoracic spine could be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated. A high attenuation 1.1 cm lesion in the region of the third ventricle \"\nwithout hypermetabolism may represent a colloid cyst but is incompletely evaluated. Consider brain MRI for further characterization if clinically indicated.    CT Abdomen 04/01/2021 showed hepatic steatosis. Small cyst in right hepatic lobe. There are two hyperenhancing lesions in the right and left lobes as well as a hypodense lesion in the left lobe, previously characterized as hemangiomas on 04/13/2012 CT. No evidence of malignancy in the abdomen.    US Abdomen 03/19/2021 showed mild hepatic steatosis unchanged along with 3 known hepatic hemangiomas is characterized on CT from 0 April 2012.

Of note, there is a small amount of osseous destruction along the posterior aspect of the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies without definite evidence of spinal canal invasion, \"\nhowever recommend correlation with neurologic exam. A slowly enlarging 1.7 cm cystic lesion in the left upper lobe is suspicious metachronous adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesion.    Chest ***** 05/15/2021 showed no pneumothorax.    CT Chest Biopsy 05/15/2021 showed pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Consolidated lung parenchyma with invasive adenocarcinoma. The tumor shows acinar, and cribriform architecture. The tumor cells are moderately pleomorphic and contain occasional mucinous vacuoles. Several mitoses are identified.     CT Chest 04/01/2021 showed right upper lobe mass measuring up to 2.5 cm, concerning for malignancy. Clustered tree-in-bud nodules in the right lower lobe and scattered calcified biapical nodules, likely reflecting chronic infection or sequela thereof.    Endoscopy  EGD 03/16/2021 showed the entire examined duodenum appeared normal. There was mild antral gastropathy noted with no significant pathologic abnormality. The mucosa of the esophagus appeared normal.     Colonoscopy 03/16/2021 showed mild non-bleeding diverticulosis in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. Five sessile polyps ranging from 6 to 12mm in size were found in the ascending colon and transverse colon; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Two sessile polyps ranging from 4 to 6mm in size were found in the sigmoid colon and rectum; polypectomy was performed using snare cautery. Retroflexed views revealed internal hemorrhoids. Prep was poor.  No very large polyp or mass, however, and no cause for weight loss found. Right colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma and tubulovillous adenoma. Left colon polyp biopsy showed fragments of tubular adenoma.          ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. male with a history of primary ***** adenocarcinoma, fatty liver disease in setting of moderate alcohol use started on sotorasib who developed transaminitis.    Abnormal liver tests due to *****: She has chronic mild rise \"\nin ***** and AST likely in setting of moderate alcohol use. Since 11/16/2021, she was found with progressive rise in ***** with ***** going up to 42, AST 257, ALT 277 and normal bilirubin. He was started on Sotorasib about 6 weeks before discovery of rise in *****. Given the temporal association, ***** induced liver injury due to Sotorasib is the most likely DDx. After stopping *****, the LFT progressively improved which further support ***** with ***** as the source of elevated LFT. The other differential diagnosis is hepatitis in setting of pembrolizumab use in August 2021 which is immune check point inhibitor. This is less likely given the temporal association which is more consistent with toxicity from *****. While it is less likely, hepatitis B flare up excluded given the persistent undetectable status of Hep B DNA. We also checked for CMV which came back negative.     Per oncology team recommendations, as the LFT improved below 2-3 times upper limit of normal, Sotorasib at half dose restarted. We recommend to monitor LFT every 2-3 weeks.     Hepatitis B exposure, He has core ab positive and negative surf Ag consistent with hepatitis B exposure. He has no evidence of cirrhosis. HBV recently rechecked which was negative. It would be reasonable to continue ***** Hep B prophylaxis with entecavir.       Fatty changes of liver, He has chronic fatty changes of liver along with mild LFT elevation prior to recent rise in *****. Given the normal work up including autoimmune, viral and ***** and absence of risk factors for NAFLD, the most likely source of fatty change of liver is moderate alcohol use. Patient stopped drinking alcohol and is maintaining sobriety for at least 6 months. Patient counseled to maintain sobriety.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No recent imaging  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 7 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing \"\nrisks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment.      Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded very nicely. However complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. More recently he has been on a treatment break to let liver recover.      CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, we continued his treatment break. Repeat restaging scans from 05/19/2022 previously reviewed. MRI brain unfortunately shows new multifocal brain metastases. CT c/a/p otherwise fairly stable. He is now s/p GK to a total of 21 targets. Now here for follow up.     Given that his main site of progression is the CNS, highest utility will be an agent with CNS activity. Unfortunately he did not respond well to carboplatin/pemetrexed/*****-based approach in 1L, and other chemotherapy options (gemcitabine, docetaxel) will likely not have much activity in the brain and do not cross ***** barrier very well. I also ***** ***** ***** whether a trial of adagrasib could be considered. He will be at high risk for hepatotoxicity with adagrasib as there is some thought that this is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors particularly after immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, adagrasib does have CNS activity and he never had progression while on ***** inhibitor so it has some advantages over his other treatment options. I \"\ndiscussed options with ***** at length today and his preference is for adagrasib trial. Started adagrasib 200 mg BID on June 22 with weekly lab monitoring for LFTs. This is the lowest possible dose but *****-1 trial did have some patients at this dose who responded. Median time to onset of hepatotoxicity is 3 weeks so we should have a sense early on. We will also set up weekly provider visits to start and continue his weekly hydration appointments. Counseled at lengths about risks and he agrees to proceed.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with stable systemic disease  - However MRI brain from 05/19/2022 showed multiple new brain mets. Now s/p GK to 21 targets.  - Discussed some options for treatment including chemo (q2 week gemcitabine but not necessarily with good CNS activity vs pemetrexed but he had PD on this before) versus a trial of adagrasib (but reasonable risk of hepatotoxicity)  - Ultimately he prefers *****. Started on lowest possible dose of adagrasib 200 mg BID, will need weekly labs for LFT monitoring to start and we will also arrange for weekly NP/MD provider visits as well to keep a very close eye on him. UA/UCx today for urinary frequency.   - Some \"\nconcern that hepatotoxicity is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors, particularly after prior *****, discussed risks at length with him today and reviewed early signs/symptoms to watch for on treatment   - CT scans and brain MRI 6 weeks after starting therapy to assess initial response   - Continue weekly infusion center visits and labs  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider. Last option might be a ***** of pemetrexed monotherapy for CNS activity, although in the past he had minimal response to 2 cycles pemetrexed-based chemo.     #Brain mets  S/p GK to 21 targets on 06/02/2022.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No recent imaging  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 7 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. \"\nHe tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, Dr. ***** thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, it was decided to stop study treatment.      Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded very nicely. However complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. More recently he has been on a treatment break to let liver recover.      CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, we continued his treatment break. Repeat restaging scans from 05/19/2022 previously reviewed. MRI brain unfortunately shows new multifocal brain metastases. CT c/a/p otherwise fairly stable. He is now s/p GK to a total of 21 targets.     Given that his main site of progression is the CNS, highest utility will be an agent with CNS activity. Unfortunately he did not respond well to carboplatin/pemetrexed/*****-based approach in 1L, and other chemotherapy options (gemcitabine, docetaxel) will likely not have much activity in the brain and do not cross ***** barrier very well. Dr ***** previously also ***** ***** ***** whether a trial of adagrasib \"\ncould be considered. He will be at high risk for hepatotoxicity with adagrasib as there is some thought that this is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors particularly after immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, adagrasib does have CNS activity and he never had progression while on ***** inhibitor so it has some advantages over his other treatment options. ***** preferred adagrasib trial. Started adagrasib 200 mg BID on June 22 with weekly lab monitoring for LFTs. This is the lowest possible dose but *****-1 trial did have some patients at this dose who responded. Median time to onset of hepatotoxicity is 3 weeks so we should have a sense early on. We will also set up weekly provider visits to start and continue his weekly hydration appointments.    - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with stable systemic disease  - However MRI brain from 05/19/2022 showed multiple new brain mets. Now s/p GK to 21 targets.  - Discussed some options for treatment including chemo (q2 week gemcitabine but not necessarily with good CNS activity vs pemetrexed but he had PD on this before) versus a trial of adagrasib (but reasonable risk of hepatotoxicity)  - Ultimately he prefers *****. \"\nStarted on lowest possible dose of adagrasib 200 mg BID, will need weekly labs for LFT monitoring to start and we will also arrange for weekly NP/MD provider visits as well to keep a very close eye on him. So far he is tolerating it well.   - Some concern that hepatotoxicity is a class effect with ***** ***** inhibitors, particularly after prior *****, discussed risks at length with him today and reviewed early signs/symptoms to watch for on treatment   - CT scans and brain MRI 6 weeks after starting therapy to assess initial response; MRI brain scheduled 08/03/2022 and CT c/a/p scheduled 08/13/2022  - Continue weekly infusion center visits and labs  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider. Last option might be a ***** of pemetrexed monotherapy for CNS activity, although in the past he had minimal response to 2 cycles pemetrexed-based chemo.     No new complaints today. Labs stable. Continue with weekly hydration.  Emphasized importance of taking adagrasib as prescribed, setting alarms to not miss doses.    #Fatigue  - Ongoing, gradually worsening. Also complaint of diaphoresis recently that raises concern for hyperthyroid.  - Continue with PT/OT for exercise, encouraged daily walking  - TFTs added to labs today (last May 2022 stable)  - ADDENDUM: TSH 0.31, T4 and T3 normal but previously out of range (T4 20 with last check). Given fluctuation of TSH and Free T4, ongoing fatigue and new diaphoresis, will e-consult endocrinology for recommendation.    #Pruritis  - Generalized, not new or worsening, not impacting sleep \"\n"},

In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded; however complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. Now on treatment break to let liver recover.     CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, Dr ***** favored continuing the treatment break. Repeat CT scans in about 8 weeks (late May). Follow up in clinic in 4 weeks to check in about symptoms. At the time of progression, could consider other gentle chemotherapy.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology consultation.     Previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of his lung biopsy pathology report. ***** testing revealed a ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 was 0%.        Then discussed staging. Based on the presence of a 2.7 cm RUL pulmonary nodule along with several bone metastases in left 6th rib, T8, and T10 (enlarging over time, FDG avid), the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. His case was discussed previously at thoracic tumor board, and the bone lesions were not felt to be amenable to biopsy but suspicion for metastases was high. Thoracic spine MRI confirmed bone metastases in the spine that in all likelihood are from his lung cancer.       Discussed treatment options. Noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. He has a ***** ***** mutation, but sotorasib is approved in the 2L only. We did have clinical trials of sotorasib-based regimens in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so we opted for standard treatment in 1L. Given low PD-L1 of 0%, we started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and pemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight \"\nloss, I empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for both carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major issues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. We discussed that sotorasib is approved in the 2L treatment of ***** ***** mutated NSCLC and previously reviewed the data for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). Side effects can include transaminase elevations, myalgias, cytopenias, GI symptoms, rashes, edema, proteinuria, or rarely pneumonitis. We also discussed our clinical trial in the 2L setting of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy (***** 101).     In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" I felt he might benefit from the closer monitoring required by the trial. He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of clinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. We have several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety we both thought it best to discontinue study treatment.    I then switched him to SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. First restaging CT scans from 11/26/2021 show a very nice response to treatment. Unfortunately, however, we had to hold sotorasib due to new ***** LFT abnormalities (elevated AST, ALT, and alk phos; \"\nbili wnl still). He was evaluated by hepatology and sotorasib was felt to be the most likely cause of his transaminitis. After improvement back down to normal range, he has been restarted on sotorasib at half dose (480 mg/day). Tolerating it well so far. We will continue labs ***** for the next three months.     Finally, discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, bone pain is now improved. ***** with SMS and is now on oxycontin 10 mg q12H with oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain. He also has lactulose prn for constipation. I think anemia is contributing to fatigue but he has expressed a desire to avoid blood transfusions for \"personal and religious reasons.\" I will start iron supplements to address component of iron deficiency anemia.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched now to standard 2L sotorasib.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% \"\n(carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021  - However now stopped study treatment for reasons above  - Had grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib 960 mg/day, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib   - Labs improve to <= grade 1, we have resumed sotorasib with one dose level reduction (480 mg/day)   - Next CT scans in about 3 months (late February); ordered but need to be scheduled   - Sotorasib monitoring: monitoring LFTs every 3 weeks for the first 3 months, then once a month. Monitor for signs/symptoms of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever). Monitor adherence.  -***** try Zyrtec for itching     #Bone mets  Bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic.

Of note, there is a small amount of osseous destruction along the posterior aspect of the T8 and T10 vertebral bodies without definite evidence of spinal canal invasion, however recommend correlation with neurologic exam. A slowly enlarging 1.7 cm cystic lesion in the left upper lobe is suspicious metachronous adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesion. Compared to 05/05/2021, new bandlike soft tissue measuring approximately 4.4 x 1.0 cm extending along the left mesorectum to the presacral region and obliterating the fat plane with the left seminal vesicle.

He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial \"\nof sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded; however complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. Now on treatment break to let liver recover.     CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, Dr ***** favored continuing the treatment break. Repeat CT scans in about 8 weeks (late May). Follow up in clinic in 4 weeks to check in about symptoms. At the time of progression, could consider other gentle chemotherapy.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib 960 mg/day, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound \"\nhyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with stable disease, plan for ongoing treatment break  - space out hydration appointments to q2 weeks for the next month, then can likely stop   - labs q4 weeks for now  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider     PLAN:  - RN and team will continue to try to reach pt by phone.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology consultation.     Previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of his lung biopsy pathology report. ***** testing revealed a ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 was 0%.        Then discussed staging. Based on the presence of a 2.7 cm RUL pulmonary nodule along with several bone metastases in left 6th rib, T8, and T10 (enlarging over time, FDG avid), the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of \"\nimprovement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment. His case was discussed previously at thoracic tumor board, and the bone lesions were not felt to be amenable to biopsy but suspicion for metastases was high. Thoracic spine MRI confirmed bone metastases in the spine that in all likelihood are from his lung cancer.       Discussed treatment options. Noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. He has a ***** ***** mutation, but sotorasib is approved in the 2L only. We did have clinical trials of sotorasib-based regimens in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so we opted for standard treatment in 1L. Given low PD-L1 of 0%, we started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and pemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight loss, I empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for both carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major issues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. We discussed that sotorasib is approved in the 2L treatment of ***** ***** mutated NSCLC and previously reviewed the data for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. \"\n***** 2021). Side effects can include transaminase elevations, myalgias, cytopenias, GI symptoms, rashes, edema, proteinuria, or rarely pneumonitis. We also discussed our clinical trial in the 2L setting of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy (***** 101).     In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" I felt he might benefit from the closer monitoring required by the trial. He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of clinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. We have several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety we both thought it best to discontinue study treatment.    I then switched him to SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. First restaging CT scans from 11/26/2021 show a very nice response to treatment. Unfortunately, however, we had to hold sotorasib due to new ***** LFT abnormalities (elevated AST, ALT, and alk phos; bili wnl still). He was evaluated by hepatology and sotorasib was felt to be the most likely cause of his transaminitis. After improvement back down to normal range, we restarted on sotorasib at half dose (480 mg/day) with close monitoring of LFTs    Unfortunately he then developed a profound hyperbilirubinemia with Tbili peak at 32 on routine labs prompting a hospital admission for workup. He underwent a liver biopsy which showed biliary ductal inflammation most consistent with drug induced liver injury, and other workup for acute liver injury including viral & obstructive causes were normal. Sotorasib was discontinued upon hospital admission and his bilirubin is now downtrending, albeit still high at ~6.    Today was his first visit with us since hospital discharge and unfortunately he has suffered a functional decline with ongoing \"\nfatigue, dizziness, and difficulty with ADLs. We did review interval staging scans which fortunately show stable disease. We will plan to stop sotorasib indefinitely given high suspicion that it directly contribute to significant liver injury and given current clinical status will go on a treatment break for ~6 weeks to allow him time to recover. ***** also work on getting home health/home PT set up to help with recovery as well as weekly hydration in infusion center and weekly lab monitoring. We will plan for repeat staging scans in 6 weeks and a discussion thereafter about next line therapies- likely chemotherapy such as gemcitabine. With pt's permission, we will also update his siblings directly.     Finally, discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, bone pain is now improved. ***** with SMS and is now on oxycontin 10 mg q12H with oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain. He also has lactulose prn for constipation. I think anemia is contributing to fatigue but he has expressed a desire to avoid blood transfusions for \"personal and religious reasons.\"  ***** with Dr. ***** who follows him for monocytosis to get him set up for iron infusions.    #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study \"\ntreatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib however complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely.    - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021  - However now stopped study treatment for reasons above  - Had grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib 960 mg/day, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib   - Labs improve to <= grade 1, so resumed sotorasib with one dose level reduction (480 mg/day)   - then developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 CT C/A/P with stable disease, plan treatment break and next scans in 6 weeks- ordered today   - weekly hydration given dizziness & functional decline   - future tx options: will likely discuss gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Can also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits)    #Acute liver injury w/ predominantly cholestatic pattern, likely sotorasib induced: Initially w ***** liver injury, cut dose to half but bili rise to 32 even on half dose prompting hospital admission. Seen by hepatology & liver bx performed, ultimately \"\n"},

We did have clinical trials of sotorasib-based regimens in the 1L, but initially Mr. ***** was overwhelmed with follow up and testing needed at the time of diagnosis and was keen on starting treatment as soon as possible, and so we opted for standard treatment in 1L. \"\nGiven low PD-L1 of 0%, we started with platinum based ***** (carboplatin and pemetrexed given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens), plus the addition of pembrolizumab. Given that he lives independently and is somewhat socially isolated (despite his good performance status) and given ongoing weight loss, I empirically dose reduced cycle 1 by 20% for both carboplatin and pemetrexed to ensure tolerability. Given poor appetite and weight loss, we kept these doses for C2 as well. In the end, he tolerated chemotherapy reasonably well and got through the two treatments without major issues.     Unfortunately, however, restaging scans from 08/20/2021 after 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** showed clear progression with increased RUL consolidation, new enlarged lymph nodes, and several new and enlarging osseous metastases. Therefore a change in therapy was merited. We discussed that sotorasib is approved in the 2L treatment of ***** ***** mutated NSCLC and previously reviewed the data for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). Side effects can include transaminase elevations, myalgias, cytopenias, GI symptoms, rashes, edema, proteinuria, or rarely pneumonitis. We also discussed our clinical trial in the 2L setting of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy (***** 101).     In the end, he opted for the clinical trial as the \"strongest option.\" I felt he might benefit from the closer monitoring required by the trial. He started study treatment on 09/29/2021 and received C1 docetaxel + sotorasib. However, it quickly became apparent that he was totally overwhelmed with the requirements of clinical trial participation. He started refusing study procedures (e.g. labs, EKG) and did not seem to understand how to take his sotorasib. We have several conversations and unfortunately in the end for his safety \"\nwe both thought it best to discontinue study treatment.    I then switched him to SoC sotorasib as 2L treatment. First restaging CT scans from 11/26/2021 show a very nice response to treatment. Unfortunately, however, we have had to hold sotorasib due to new ***** LFT abnormalities (elevated AST, ALT, and alk phos; bili wnl still). Given that labs still ***** despite holding treatment for 10 days, I have also referred him to hepatology for further work up and management. Suspect this is sotorasib-induced liver injury but appreciate hepatology input. Today overall LFT trending down, will draw labs again today if normal will start on Sotorasib 480mg/day with labs ***** for the next three months.     Finally, discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, bone pain is now improved. ***** with SMS and is now on oxycontin 10 mg q12H with oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough pain. He also has lactulose prn for constipation. I think anemia is contributing to fatigue but he has expressed a desire to avoid blood transfusions for \"personal and religious reasons.\" I will start iron supplements to address component of iron deficiency anemia.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles show clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt \"\ncompletely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched now to standard 2L sotorasib.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021  - However now stopped study treatment for reasons above  - Had grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib 960 mg/day, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib   - Labs improve to <= grade 1 or baseline, will resume on dose level reduction (480 mg/day)   - Next CT scans in about 3 months (late February), order today  - Sotorasib monitoring: monitoring LFTs every 3 weeks for the first 3 months, then once a month. Monitor for signs/symptoms of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever). Monitor adherence.  -***** try Zyrtec for itching     #Bone mets  Bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. I do recommend dentist clearance before starting given the risk of ONJ. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic. So far we have held off on bone modifying agents but can continue to discuss after he follows up with dentist.     -***** does have a dentist, he \"\nwill see them soon and ask about bisphosphate clearance--still pending  -Pain: oxycontin 20 mg q12H + oxycodone 5 mg prn,  -RT would be reasonable as needed for palliation of painful bony *****, but on hold for now since he is responding to systemic therapy     #DVT  Acute DVT in bilateral gastrocnemius veins on lower extremity ultrasound on 08/07/2021. Due to confusion about dosing or rivaroxaban he briefly stopped and then developed more edema and repeat u/s with acute DVT bilaterally. He is now back on rivaroxaban 20 mg/day dose once daily.   -Continue rivaroxaban 20 mg/day    #Prior hepatitis B  Positive hepatitis B core and surface antibody but negative surface antigen and negative DNA at prior checks, consistent with prior infection. He was started on entecavir for ppx while on chemotherapy and follow serial hepatitis B DNA levels.   - Entecavir 0.5 mg/day while on chemo  - Trend hepatitis B DNA levels; hepatology recommends repeat now     #Urinary frequency  -UA not suggestive of infection     #Low positive Hep C ab  Follow up Hep C RNA from 09/29/2021 was negative      #Supportive Care   - Connect with Dr. *****, PCP   - SW consult to help with psycho-social challenges, stress related to cancer diagnosis, resources for transportation (done)  - Prefers to be contacted via email if possible    - Bone pain: working with SMS, on oxycontin 10 mg q12H + oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn breakthrough   - Established care in ***** clinic, appreciate co-management   - Anemia: likely in part side effect of chemotherapy plus component of iron deficiency + chronic inflammation. ***** start iron 325 mg every other day for now.   - Home RN/PT/OT/SW all requested given his cognitive issues, limited ***** to assist with home safety eval, mediation management, wellness checks     Advance care planning  This patient has named a surrogate decision maker.

HPI: The patient has history of hypertension, anxiety, and SIADH, and presented to the emergency room on 05/13/20 with complaints of chest pain and upper abdominal pain. She did report consumption of nearly one bottle of wine per day although was trying to cut back due to the pain. She denied any cough or weight loss. She is a smoker and has used one pack per day for 30 years although at some point she was able to quit for 2 years but restarted smoking during COVID. She recently moved to ***** ***** from ***** ***** approximately one year ago, and she lives with her nephew. In the emergency room she had CT scan of chest abdomen and pelvis which showed a spiculated left upper lobe nodule suspicious for primary lung malignancy, and enlarged left hilar and AP window lymph nodes of 13 and 10 mm respectively. There were also some smaller nodules in both lungs which were nonspecific, as well as moderate emphysema, small pericardial effusion, bilateral adrenal gland enlargement and nodularity suspicious for metastatic disease but nonspecific. There were also coarse calcifications in the pancreas consistent with prior episodes of pancreatitis, ill-defined soft tissue infiltration between stomach and pancreas likely inflammatory, small amount of ascites, heterogeneous uterus, and suggestion of possible left adnexal mass versus colon configuration. Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe 2.4 cm masslike density. Abdominal ultrasound was consistent with pancreatitis and extensive pancreatic calcifications. She was admitted for treatment of pancreatitis.  During the admission, she underwent CT-guided biopsy of the left \"\n12), PD-L1 expressor >50%, now with metastatic disease in multiple lymph node regions including bilateral supraclavicular, left axillary, subcarinal and mediastinal, aortocaval and gastrohepatic.  She does not have any visceral organ or bone involvement.  Brain MRI was negative.  Past treatment included 4 cycles of neoadjuvant *****/Alimta in September 2020 which was well tolerated. PET/CT scan at completion of chemo showed very good partial response.  She then underwent left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection at ***** by Dr ***** on 12/13/20. Pathology showed residual high grade 2.5 cm adenocarcinoma and 6 positive lymph nodes, without extracapsular extension, but there was lymphovascular invasion. She completed adjuvant radiation therapy to the mediastinum over 5 weeks, which was also very well tolerated, ending in March 2021. She then completed adjuvant Atezolizumab X 18 doses, last on 05/08/22.    Unfortunately she presented with metastatic disease to lymph nodes on imaging in July 2022. This was biopsy-proven from the left supraclavicular lymph node that shows adenocarcinoma of lung primary.  Lymphadenopathy was up to 2 cm in size, and bilateral cervical, left axillary, mediastinal, aortocaval and gastrohepatic regions. NGS panel from left SCL LN as well as from prior lung tissue showed ***** p.***** mutation.  Therefore ***** was started on sotorasib 960 mg daily and so far this is very well tolerated. She has been on it for 3 months now. CBC and LFTs remain normal.    Current CT C/A/P shows great response with all enlarged lymph nodes reduced in size and some now completely normal. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are noted and no new disease was noted.  We will cont current sotorasib treatment, and plan another CT scan in 4 months. She will repeat labs in 2 months from now and then again before the CT scan.    ***** has also met with Dr ***** and palliative care team. She was interested in learning \"\nmore about the right to die at. She would like to have a plan for the future as she does not have a lot of support in this area; she lives in ***** ***** with strangers and does not want to end up in a nursing home.    # Hx pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation: pancreatitis is resolved and pancreatic tail cyst is now resolved. She is asymptomatic. She uses pancreatic enzymes with meals.    # Hx SIADH. This has been a chronic problem prior to her cancer diagnosis. She did have a recent hospitalization for severe hyponatremia and did establish care with nephrology. She is on NaCl tabs and will cont 2 tablets daily. Na is now 135.    # Hx hypothyroidism, worsened with autoimmune thyroiditis: on synthroid, managed by Dr *****. Recently dose was reduced.    # HTN: this is acute finding today but ***** is in visible emotional stress due to her roommate who was hospitalized. She is otherwise asymptomatic. She will follow up on her blood pressure at home.    # *****: on Lipitor now, tolerating well.     # Follow-up: in 4 months after the CT scan, with Dr *****.       #  Pain  Pain assessment for this encounter  Pain Score/Location    12/26/22 1327   *****:  0       Pain management plan outlined below as of 12/25/22   n/a      Below for billing only         I spent a total of 30 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.                                     \"\nupper lobe lung mass. Pathology has come back as adenocarcinoma arising in association with a fibroid last 6 car. PD L1 DPS score was strong positive in 95%. Additional molecular markers were requested. I had recommended a PET scan to be done as outpatient and she is now returning to discuss that. In addition she had pelvic ultrasound on 05/14/20 prior to leaving the hospital which showed myomatous uterus but normal appearing ovaries bilaterally and no left adnexal mass detected.  She saw pulmonology, Dr *****, for EBUS and bx of the AP window lymph node - was not successful. After a discussion at our local tumor board, recs were made for referral to thoracic surgery to complete staging and evaluation for surgery. She saw Dr ***** ***** but also wanted to be seen by a thoracic surgeon specifically and was therefore referred to ***** ***** ***** at *****.    NGS testing showed ***** p.***** mutation in 3% of cells.    PAST THERAPY: s/p 4 cycles of neoadjuvant Carboplatin and Pemetrexed, C4D1 on 10/07/20.  12/13/20: S/p ***** lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node resection by Dr *****,  revealing 2.5cm residual tumor (40% viable), high grade, +LVI, negative margins, June 21 LNs involved (no *****), *****.  02/08/21-03/15/21: adjuvant XRT 5000 cGy in 25 fractions.  Atezolizumab q 21 days, started 04/21/2021, for total of 18 doses, last 05/08/22.    Unfortunately PET scan on 08/14/22 showed metastatic disease in mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  PET scan showed only involvement of the lymph nodes but no visceral organs (including 20 mm right cervical lymph node with SUV of 5.9, left supraclavicular 2.6 cm lymph node with SUV of 4.85, left 15 mm axillary lymph node with SUV of 6.6, 2.4 cm subcarinal lymph node with SUV of 2.79, 8 mm anterior mediastinal lymph node with SUV of 2.29, and then additional aortocaval, periaortic, and gastrohepatic adenopathy with SUV of 3.88).  Brain MRI showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  \"\nOn 08/21/2022 she underwent ultrasound biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph node with pathology showing metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary.  PDL-L1 was 30%.    CURRENT THERAPY: Lumakras (Sotorasib) 960 mg daily started 09/17/22.

Review of Prior Imaging: I personally reviewed and interpreted each of the patient's relevant imaging studies in conjunction with the co ***** formal radiology reports, as outlined in my HPI/Oncologic History     12/22/22: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:     1. Significant interval decrease \"\nin size and/or resolution of previously seen thoracic and abdominal lymphadenopathy, detailed above. No evidence of new metastatic disease or lymphadenopathy in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.     2. Stable post surgical changes related to left upper lobectomy with similar chronic loculated left apical pleural effusion. No definite evidence of local recurrence or new suspicious pulmonary nodules.     08/14/22: PET scan  IMPRESSION:     1. Hypermetabolic metastatic lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, and abdomen, as detailed above.     2. Status post left upper lobectomy. Mild wedge-shaped soft tissue and/or fluid noted along the resection margin with associated mild hypermetabolism peripherally (SUV max 2.76, March 26:64), nonspecific.     3. Mild patchy interstitial and groundglass opacities noted throughout the left lower lobe with areas of associated mild hypermetabolism (SUV max 2.83); these findings are new compared to ***** chest 08/07/2022, and thus favored to be infectious/inflammatory in etiology.       08/12/22: MRI brain  IMPRESSION:     1. No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.     2. Mild burden of chronic white matter small vessel ischemic change.     08/07/22: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:     1. Compared to 02/13/2022 there is progression of metastatic disease with increased size and number of mediastinal, left subpectoral, retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy as described above.     2. Stable postsurgical changes status post left upper lobectomy without evidence of local disease recurrence.       04/22/22: CT brain non-con  IMPRESSION:     1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage, herniation or hydrocephalus.     2. Chronic white matter small vessel ischemic change.     02/13/22: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:   1. Postop changes in the chest (left upper lobectomy) without evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Diminished left pleural fluid collection as above.   2. No infradiaphragmatic metastatic disease \"\ndetected. Resolved pancreatic cyst; stable left adreniform fullness.     07/21/21: CT C/A/P  IMPRESSION:   1. Postop changes left upper lobectomy, stable loculated left anterior superior pleural fluid collection. Tiny left posterior-inferior pleural effusion.   2. Shotty mediastinal/left hilar nodes.   3. Sequela of chronic pancreatitis with multiple calcifications + new approximately 14 mm nonenhancing pancreatic tail cyst.   4. Nonspecific mild dilation of few small bowel loops, correlate clinically.     04/04/21 CT C/A/P:  IMPRESSION:     1. Status post left upper lobectomy without evidence of residual parenchymal disease.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 0%), here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      #Pulmonary adenocarcinoma  Stage IV, isolated RUL pulmonary nodule but multiple bone metastases. ***** with ***** *****, PD-L1 0%.  He was started on carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 0%, chemo dose reduced by 20% given frailty and some social isolation. He tolerated it okay, but unfortunately restaging scans after 2 cycles showed clear progression in the bones. In 2L, he was initially enrolled in our ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel; he was interested in the study and given aggressive tempo of his disease, I thought the combination had the highest chance of efficacy. He was formally consented for the study after discussing risks/benefits/alternatives and proceeded with C1D1. Unfortunately, however, essentially immediately after starting study treatment he felt completely overwhelmed with the study requirements, to the point where he was unable to fully  follow up with study procedures and impacting patient safety. So in the end, in shared decision-making we decided to stop study treatment. Switched  to standard 2L sotorasib to which he responded; however complicated by profound hyperbilirubinemia (Tbili 32) after several months despite dose reduction, thus now stopped indefinitely. More recently he has been on a treatment break to let liver recover. \"\n    CT scans from 04/02/2022 for restaging showed overall, stable disease, no new mets, no clear progression. His LFTs have only just now normalized and he continues to feel better off treatment. In the absence of clear cancer progression or related symptoms, we continued his treatment break.    Today, we reviewed restaging scans from 05/19/2022. MRI brain unfortunately shows new multifocal brain metastases. CT c/a/p otherwise fairly stable. He has been referred to rad onc for WBRT vs GK. He is feeling very overwhelmed, but we discussed possibly resumption of some gentle chemotherapy after he finishes radiation. He did not have a response to prior 2 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, pembrolizumab. Could trial q2 week gemcitabine as next systemic therapy (but not particularly CNS active) or a retrial of pemetrexed alone (which has better CNS activity). However for now given that he is easily overwhelmed and his systemic disease is stable, will prioritize RT to the new CNS mets and I will see him back in a few weeks to make decision about systemic tx.     - s/p 2 cycles 1L carboplatin/pemetrexed + ***** given PD-L1 of 0%. Empirically dose reduced cycles 1 and 2 by 20% (carboplatin AUC 4, pemetrexed 400 mg/m2)   - Scans after 2 cycles show progression in bones and LN  - Consented for ***** 101 trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemo given ***** ***** mutation, C1D1 on 09/29/2021. However stopped study treatment several days in as discussed above  - He has had now two episodes of >= grade 3 transaminase elevations on sotorasib 960 mg/day, most likely drug-induced liver injury April 08 sotorasib. Second episode despite dose reduction to 480 mg/day, developed profound hyperbilirubinemia w bili to 32 on half dose sotorasib prompting hospital admission & liver bx consistent with *****- sotorasib now stopped indefinitely   - 02/12/22 and 04/02/2022 CT C/A/P with stable systemic disease  - However MRI brain from 05/19/2022 showed \"\nmultiple new brain mets. Referred to rad onc to discuss WBRT vs GK, awaiting tumor board discussion   - Discussed restarting systemic therapy as well (either q2 week gemcitabine vs pemetrexed) but his systemic disease is actually fairly stable and he is feeling very overwhelmed with news about brain mets, so would prioritize RT to brain first   -I will see him back in a few weeks to continue to discuss systemic therapy   - Continue labs q2 weeks for now  - future tx options: will likely discuss weekly gemcitabine monotherapy, docetaxel can also be considered if clinical status improves and bilirubin <1, although did not tolerate one cycle when briefly on ***** trial. Could theoretically also consider ***** regimen although may be challenging for tolerability (and ***** not ideal on anticoagulation although could discuss risks/benefits) or ipi/***** is another option to consider. Last option might be a ***** of pemetrexed monotherapy for CNS activity, although in the past he had minimal response to 2 cycles pemetrexed-based chemo.     PLAN:  - Urgent radiation oncology referral for brain mets (done, he will see Dr. ***** later this week)  - continue dex 2 mg BID for now   - finalize systemic therapy plans after he completes RT; he is feeling overwhelmed as it is and wants to get through radiation first before making a decision about restarting chemo     #Anemia  -Additional dose of feraheme given on May 21  -Repeat labs day of next infusion center appointment on June 02; consider repeat doses of feraheme if still anemic  -He declines blood transfusions for religious reasons     Advance care planning  This patient has named a surrogate decision maker.

Notable findings in the current stage of cancer include ongoing treatment with gemcitabine \"\nchemotherapy.  Most recent prior brain MRI available is from July 2022.  Since then she has had radiation to the brain metastasis.  Would recommend to obtain a new brain MRI to establish stability as it is a important factor for eligibility for the trials.  We currently have 3 ongoing K-ras ***** ***** targeting therapy trials. Given that she has had prior treatment with sotorasib she is not eligible for two of them and given prior history of significant toxicity with sotorasib use she would not be eligible for the third study.      PLAN  We discussed the following trials:  - ***** ***** Phase 1 First-Time-in-Human, Open-***** Study of *****  Administered as Monotherapy and in ***** with Anticancer Agents in  ***** with Selected Advanced ***** Tumors  - *****#***** Study of SGN-STNV in ***** ***** ***** *****  - ***** phase 1 study of *****/2 inhibitor *****-1187 administered as monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib for the treatment of advanced solid tumors with MAPK pathway mutations      This is a visit to discuss participation in a phase I trial.  In order to initiate the consenting process we discussed the following:     Phase I trials in general: The broader nature of Phase I trials were discussed. Unlike Phase II trials which test preliminary efficacy in a homogeneous population, or Phase III trials which compare against the best current standard of care, the primary focus of Phase I is safety and toxicity of a ***** compound, modality or combination. The lowest dose of the trial is a comparable dose found to be tolerable in animal studies. Doses are then escalated in a prescribed fashion. While the expected toxicities are detailed in the consent from, toxicities at any level can be unexpected and severe. We will follow the participant very carefully with very frequent visits in the first weeks. At any time we will inform the patient of new findings that may change the patient's willingness \"\nto participate or may ***** extra risks. We do not know whether there will be any benefit of this study to the patient. The participation in a Phase I study has been discussed in context of the patient’s other options and the extent of the underlying disease.     Eligibly: Most studies have very specific eligibility criteria which all must be met. All required screening tests will be initiated only after the patient has given formal consent by signing the consent form. If the patient is found not to be eligible, we will refer the patient back to the referring physician or discuss participation in another study.      Participation in a clinical trial: We discussed that the participation to an early stage clinical trial is voluntary and that the patient may withdraw participation at any time for any reasons. We asked the patient to agree to all protocol specific visits and tests to monitor the progress and ensure the well being of the patient. We will stop the study proceedings if there is concern that continuation may put the patient at risk.      Consent form: The UCSF Experimental Subjects ***** of rights will be reviewed with the patient prior to signing the consent form and a signed copy will be been given to the patient.  Alternative treatment to the patient's disease in ***** of clinical trial participation has been discussed with the patient.  Possible risks and possible side effects of participation in this clinical trial have been discussed.  The patient has been given opportunity to ask questions.        Current pain and/or distress:  The pain and/or distress that the diagnosis and its treatment carries were discussed     I reviewed treatment options, treatment side effects in detail.    I reviewed the patient's medical information and medical history. I have reviewed the past medical, family, and social history sections including the medications and allergies listed in the above medical record.    Patient \"\ncounseled regarding: goals of care; treatment options, risk and benefits of clinical trials, and study drug/treatment side effects; radiographic imaging findings; discussion of study procedures and schedules;      Next steps  - Obtain brain MRI with and without contrast to determine current status of brain mets  - Advised to touch base with our clinic at the time of next scan and completion of 2 cycles of gemcitabine as per primary oncologist      Follow up  The patient and patient's family had ample opportunity to discuss the nature of phase I trials with me today.     We will proceed with the consenting process and screening if the patient is interested and we have a suitable trial at time of return.      I also discussed that the patient's primary oncologist should assume care of the patient until clinical trial initiation.  Upon initiation of the clinical trial, we will work in partnership with the patient's referring oncologist.  All clinical trial specific procedures must be done at *****.  ***** labs and scans can be done locally.

Right pleural fluid, cytology:   Adenocarcinoma, favor pulmonary primary; see comment.     B. Lung, station 7 lymph node, fine needle aspiration:   Metastatic adenocarcinoma, favor pulmonary primary; see comment.     C. Lung, station 4R lymph node, fine needle aspiration:   Metastatic adenocarcinoma; see comment.         COMMENTS:   Thank you for the opportunity to review this case. We agree with the  original pathologist's diagnoses.     In part A (right pleural fluid), the sample is hypercellular and shows  cohesive groups of malignant epithelial cells in a background of mixed  inflammation. The malignant cells have abundant delicate cytoplasm,  prominent mucin cytoplasmic mucin vacuoles, and enlarged irregular  nuclei with vesicular chromatin. The cell block is concordant with  abundant tumor present, and highlights the mucinous features and  signet-ring cell morphology.     The provided immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells in specimen  A are:  CK7:          Positive  *****:          Negative (only rare cells with weak staining, interpreted  as \"\nnegative\"  *****:          Positive  *****:          Positive  D2-40:          Negative  Calretinin:     Negative  *****:          Negative    In part B (station 7 lymph node), the sample is abundantly cellular and  shows clusters of tumor cells with similar morphology to that seen in  part A. The background is composed of lymphoid elements and cartilage.     The provided immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells in specimen  B are:  CK7:          Positive  *****:          Positive  *****:          Negative    In part C (station 4R lymph node), the sample is moderately cellular and  shows clusters of tumor cells with similar morphology to that seen in  parts A and B. The background is composed of scant lymphoid elements,  cartilage, and fibroconnective tissue.     The provided immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells in specimen  C are:  CK7:          Positive  *****:          Negative  *****:          Negative  *****:          Negative    The immunophenotype of this tumor is somewhat non-specific  (*****-positive and *****-positive) and can be seen in upper  gastrointestinal tumors and primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Based on  the presence of a lung mass (and if GI primaries are ruled out  clinically), then this adenocarcinoma is favored to be of pulmonary  origin.    Furthermore, in specimen C the tumor shows loss of TTF and *****, and may  represent a poorly differentiated component. Since the tumor cells are  morphologically similar to those in specimen A and B, a second primary  is unlikely.     Dr. ***** ***** and Dr. ***** ***** of UCSF Pulmonary Pathology have  reviewed the case and concur.        Clinical History  The patient is an *****-year-old man with a lung mass who underwent fine  needle aspiration biopsies of station 7 and 4R lymph nodes, and  collection of right pleural fluid. Dr. ***** ***** requests a UCSF  pathologist review this case.

For your nausea, we treated it aggressively with medications. We also scanned your belly and brain to see if there was a clear reason why you were nauseous, but we did not find anything. We hope it will improve with time and with draining the fluid around your lung.    We found that you had a lot of fluid around your lung (pleural effusion). We drained it and there was still a lot of fluid so our interventional radiology team placed a Pleurx catheter so you can continue to drain the fluid at home. We have set you up with home health services as well to help you with regaining your strength.

Mr. ***** is here with his wife for a second opinion about management. He had rotator cuff surgery in May 2021 and afterwards lost about 12 lbs unintentionally, which prompted work up including a CXR that lead to the diagnosis. Overall he is much more symptomatic now than 6 months ago, before his diagnosis. He is newly on supplemental oxygen over the last few months, now on 4L which was a recent increase from 3L. He also notes lower back pain. He's taking norco, tolerating it better than morphine (tremors). Also had two episodes this week where his right leg felt weak and he \"crumpled\" to the floor. He started sotorasib today. He's lost a fair amount of weight, baseline was around 175 lbs, now down \"\nto 155 lbs although it has started to stabilize.

Imaging result in ***** above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 1%) with pleural and bone metastases, s/p carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab x2 cycles and just started on sotorasib. Here for a second opinion about management.     We discussed the pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma based on review of his lymph node biopsies. The morphology and IHC staining pattern was not specific for a site of origin. The morphology with abundant mucin and signet ring features is often associated with upper GI primaries but also can be found in pulmonary adenocarcinomas; and IHC staining pattern was not specific with CK7+ but negative for TTF-1 and *****. Ultimately, given radiographic pattern of spread and a negative recent EGD, his local team has been treating him for a presumed pulmonary primary. We will request slides for an internal UCSF pathology review to try to confirm the diagnosis and primary site, which might help guide decisions about chemotherapy choices in the future. Foundation NGS revealed a ***** ***** mutation.     We then discussed staging. Based on pleural and bone involvement on PET scans, the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but \"\nwith reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.    We then discussed treatment options. I noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. Without diagnosed activating mutations, he was approximately started on platinum based *****; local oncologist started with carboplatin and ***** (given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens) plus pembrolizumab. Restaging PET scan after 2 cycles showed a mixed response, with an increase in ***** uptake of some bone mets and the gluteal muscle metastasis, but with other mets stable to slightly improved. I will request formal UCSF radiology overread of his most recent PET scan as another assessment for interval response to first two cycles. Regardless, Mr. ***** just started today sotorasib today given his ***** ***** mutation. I can't tell from the records whether this decision was made for progression or a decision a priori to switch to targeted therapy. Regardless, however, I think it's reasonable to continue this regimen for now both for better tolerability and because often targeted therapy works better when given earlier in the course of disease. We reviewed the data today for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). In the future, depending on what UCSF's assessment is about his recent PET/CT and also on his performance status, we might consider a retrial of carboplatin/*****/pembrolizumab (given that overall disease burden appears fairly stable with a few mild areas of PD) or selecting other empiric chemo regimens that have activity in both lung and upper GI primaries (e.g. carboplatin/paclitaxel or gemcitabine), or more of a GI specific regimen (FOLFOX). Depending on his treatment goals and PS clinical trials could be another option. I encouraged him to check in around the \"\ntimes of scans in the future particularly if clinical trials are of interest.     Finally, we discussed supportive care. At this time, bone pain, weight loss, and respiratory symptoms requiring oxygen are his most bothersome symptoms. I've referred him to symptom management and nutritionist at our cancer center to start. He is working with his local oncologist on regimen for better controlling his pain. I encouraged him to be forthcoming about new symptoms as they arise.      Plan:     #Stage IV adenocarcinoma  Suspected lung primary, but morphology and IHC staining is not entirely specific per local path review and could be consistent with either a lung or an upper GI primary. Foundation NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 1%. Pleural and bone mets at diagnosis, requiring 4L NC O2. He is s/p 2 cycles carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** and now just started sotorasib.   - UCSF internal path review to try to confirm diagnosis, as this could have implications   - Plan to review his path and radiology at an upcoming thoracic tumor board for multidisciplinary group input  - Formal UCSF radiology overread requested on PET/CT from 10/02/2021 to confirm whether he has progressed on 2 cycles carboplatin, pemetrexed, and *****  - For now, continue sotorasib for ***** *****. I will clarify with his local oncologist whether this was started for PD or not.  - We would typically repeat restaging CT c/a/p with contrast 6 to 8 weeks after starting sotorasib to determine initiation response  - Follow up as needed moving forward around the times of scans    #Pleural effusion  Now has pleurX catheter in place, he is draining about *****-***** cc a week.     #Bone metastases  We discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. He has \"\nrecently been started on denosumab by local oncologist. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic. He's had a course of RT to several painful bony mets including R scapula and thoracic spine.   - Agree with denosumab  - Continue norco prn typically 3x a day    #COPD  Recent diagnosis, due to DLCo severely reduced at 28% predicted. Not entirely clear if this is due to emphysema or if there is also a component due to lymphangitic spread of cancer. He is now on supplemental oxygen, 4L NC. Some relief with nebulizer treatments.  - Formoterol, budesonide, and atrovent BID     #Anxiety  He reports panic attacks worsened in the setting of stress over diagnosis.  -Seroquel 25 mg     #SSS  S/p PPM for symptomatic bradycardia. Unfortunately he can't get MRI brain as a result.     #AFlutter  He is on eliquis 5 mg    RTC in 2 months, around the time of next scans to check in     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 60 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer \"\n"},

Her friend ***** is here as a healthcare advocate to help take notes. She reports feeling horrible overall, in particular over the last few weeks. Last week she \"\nhad a self-described 'breakdown.' Triggered by severe abdominal pain that has worsened dramatically over the last few weeks. Cause of this pain isn't entirely clear. She thought it might be due to a recurrent large central abdominal hernia, or maybe swollen lymph nodes in her abdomen, but no one has been entirely sure. Pain location is the upper abdomen, radiating around sides to back, severe/relentless, described as a constant pressure and occasionally a stabbing/hot pain. She had a bowel movement a few days ago followed by diarrhea, constipation has been a recurrent issue and she's on a bowel regimen. She had a celiac plexus block 2 weeks ago that did not provide much relief. In retrospect, pain may have worsened after she abruptly stopped taking all her medications last week, including her narcotics and sotorasib. In hindsight, she thinks the pain just got to her and she wanted a break; she had also been worried about addiction with using narcotics and so had wanted to do a home detox of sorts--but acknowledges that it didn't go well, pain worsened, plus she developed nausea and vomiting from withdrawals. Now she's feeling a bit better, working with her palliative care team and there's a plan for her pain regimen. She does think the lumps/lymph nodes in her neck have gotten appreciably smaller since starting sotorasib and she does not think she's having any side effects from this treatment. Chemo took a lot out of her in terms of fatigue, hair loss, etc and the targeted therapy is more tolerable. Here today to talk about trials and next steps for cancer treatment, along with any other strategies for managing and coping with pain.

No results found for: WBC, HGB, PLT, *****, NA, K, CL, CO2, BUN, CREAT, GFRC, *****, *****, MG, PO4, TBILI, AST, ALT, ALKP, ALB, TSH, *****, FT4    ***** Labs (09/04/2021):  CBC: 9.5 > 7.2 < 376  BMP: Na 132, K 3.9, Cl 93, bicarb 24, Cr 0.49, Ca 9.1  LFTs: AST 10, ALT 10, alk phos 109, total bilirubin 0.3    RADIOGRAPHIC RESULTS   I personally reviewed and interpreted each of the patient's relevant imaging studies in conjunction with the corresponding formal radiology reports, as outlined in my Assessment/Plan. Imaging result in ***** above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with \"\nstage IV lung adenocarcinoma (***** ***** mutation, also mutations in  *****, KEAP1, and SETD2), here for initial medical oncology consultation.    We discussed the pathological diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma based on review of her outside biopsy reports. We will attempt to have the slides from her initial lung biopsy along with her colon surgery sent her to UCSF. I will ask our pathologists to confirm that the ascending colon tumor looks consistent with her original lung primary, and that the distal colon tumor appears like a separate primary colorectal cancer.     We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven cervical lymph node and colonic metastases, along with a solitary brain metastasis at diagnosis, the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.    We then discussed treatment options. I noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. She has had multiple prior lines of therapy, including several local therapies (L VATS and pleurodesis, SRS to a brain metastasis), pembrolizumab monotherapy, one dose of pemetrexed c/b an allergic reaction, 4 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel, and most recently started on sotorasib for lymph node progression.For now, I recommend continuing with sotorasib. She is tolerating sotorasib well with tentative improvement in the palpable lymphadenopathy in her neck. She is due for restaging scans later this month, which will be important for assessing initial response.     We then discussed clinical trial options. At the time of progression, I would consider a repeat tumor or liquid biopsy to look for any new actionable mutations. We have several potential early phase clinical trials that could be considered at the time of progression on sotorasib given her ***** ***** mutation. These include a ***** mRNA \"\nvaccine candidate plus pembrolizumab; a phase I trial of the the ***** inhibitor RMC-4630; or a phase I trial of an ***** December 02 inhibitor +/- dabrafenib. I will also review her molecular profiling results at our molecular tumor board to see if there are other trials to potentially consider given her mutation profile.     Finally, we discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, debilitating abdominal pain is dramatically impacting her quality of life. She has an SMS team at ***** that knows her well. I will reach out to them to discuss her case. She has already received a celiac plexus nerve block without much durable relief. I offered to refer her to the pain management team here at ***** as well to see if any other interventions or treatments might be helpful. I will also discuss with radiology whether there are any lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum that could be explaining her symptoms; if so, we could investigate whether there is any role for palliative radiation for pain control. We also had a lengthy discussion today about the utility of opiates in treating cancer-related pain and the differences between physical dependence and psychological addiction. At this time, her pain is     Advance care planning  Unknown if patient has named a surrogate decision maker. Provider deferred discussion.    Plan:     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Stage IV with brain, lymph node, colon metastases. She is s/p multiple prior lines of therapy including L VATS and pleurodesis, SRS to R parietal met, *****, one cycle pemetrexed (c/b allergic reaction), 4 cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel, now on sotorasib.   - Continue sotorasib for now given that she is tolerating it and has not yet had clear cancer progression on this standard of care treatment option   - Would repeat restaging scans by the end of this month to assess initial response  - At the time of progression on sotorasib, that would be a good time to pursue a clinical trial. We \"\ndiscussed several potential trails today available through our early phase group.   - I will review her Tempus NGS findings at molecular tumor board to help prioritize future trials  - Request outside slides from original biopsy and colon surgery to confirm diagnosis     #Abdominal pain  - Review images with radiology to try to identify if there's an anatomic cause that would be amenable to palliative RT; and recommend this be revisited after her restaging scans later this month   - I will follow up with her local SMS team about her treatment plan; they appear to know her very well and have been working with her closely on the plan   - Consider referral to pain management at ***** for another opinion about best way to manage and whether there is a role for any other interventions (another celiac nerve block etc)    RTC as needed, particularly after scans or at the time of progression to discuss clinical trials     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 60 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection \"\n"},

Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.     Chief Complaint  Follow-up      History of Present Illness  ***** ***** ***** is an ***** y.o. male who is referred to interventional pulmonary clinic by Dr. ***** for evaluation L mainstem and LLL bronchial stents. Accompanied by wife *****.    Previous History:  He is well known to us and has had multiple bronchoscopies for malignant central airway obstruction due to metastatic colon cancer to distal L main bronchus. LLL bronchus debulked (April 2020) then stented (09/06/20), however, tumor grew over this site and he required recanalization with repeat stent placement (03/01/21).    CT chest May 2021 shows again complete LLL obstruction from tumor invasion.     At last visit 05/08/21, he reported that after his last airway stent placement, he developed sputum tasting like burnt seaweed which was very bothersome. CXR possible effusion. Ultrasound did not show large enough effusion for thoracentesis. Treated with Z-pack for possible PNA and foul-tasting seaweed resolved. However, couple weeks ago ***** motorcycle to 10,000 feet in ***** and became very fatigued, confused and was unable to complete ride back home; suspected hypoxia. Otherwise, no limitations in his activities: still enjoys walking the dog and remains quite active. He does continue to cough up \"\nmucous. He is using his 3% saline and ***** valve. He was about to start radiation therapy.     10/30/21  Since seeing me last, he has been hospitalized several times for staph bacteremia of unclear source.  Concern for chronic ongoing pulmonary source and thus patient was *****'d from ***** to UCSF for stent revision.  Dr. ***** removed one stent and replaced another and I appears that much of the inspissated mucous has now been coughed up.  The lung distal to the obstruction appears ***** but is now aerated and Mr. ***** is sating 98% on RA in lake tahoe today.   He continues to use 3% saline and his aerobika.  He was using ICS and is taking 3,500.  After using this recent, he coughed up several ml of bright red blood.      01/28/22  ***** off ***** on left chest and shoulder. He reports that he had a gun in the front left breast pocket so the hard impact of the ***** caused bruising over that area.     He reports some difficulty with sleeping. Has to sleep on right side to breath better. He is also having increased mucus production. Using nebulizer mounted onto ***** 3% saline BID, which helps a lot. He notes there was an additive that he was given in the hospital that smelled like eggs that really improved mucus clearance as well. But overall, he is exercising less than baseline. Continues with Care ***** treatment program, scheduled for repeat scan February 14. Continues physical therapy and continues to check ***** at home. Now it is 97%. Mild weight gain but he relates this to decrease in exercise.    No fevers, night sweats, or chills.    Hx of adenocarcinoma in colon. On IV panitumumab and maintenance dose doxy 100mg.    02/26/22    Patient is feeling okay. He has been recovering from his shoulder injury. He had a reverse shoulder surgery which limited his physical activity resulting in increased congestion. He has been coughing up sticky, tan colored mucus with occasional brown streaks. He notes \"\nsymptoms of mucus and runny nose began about a year ago so within the last week he started taking vitamin C which seems to be helping.     He notes being back to 4000 steps per day.        He has been experiencing cramps in his left lower rib cage area when he ***** up. Stretching his upper torso helps alleviate the cramp.       Interval History:   Patient well known to the ***** service, he has been closely followed by Dr ***** who is on paternity leave. We are following today for ROS. Dr ***** last saw Mr ***** ~3 months ago with the plan for ongoing expectant management and ROS after a repeat chest CT which was performed on 05/08/22  Breathing is \"OK, not what it was once\". He is coughing up a lot of stuff. He can walk his dog and perform ADLs  He notes a stepwise decline  He is coughing up mainly clear sputum, occasionally cloudy and brown, occasionally with streaks of blood  He remains on Doxycycline, given as part of his clinical trial (through ***** *****) for treatment related acne; he started the trial ~1 year ago    I have personally reviewed the CT chest from 05/08/22 and interpret it to show no change to total left sided lung collapse, no change to stents in the ***** -> LLL.

COMMENT:    Thank you for the opportunity to review these two cases. We agree with  the original pathologist's diagnoses for both.     In case *****-*****-*****, all three pleural biopsies show similar  morphologic features. H&E sections show an infiltrating tumor composed  of enlarged cells with irregular nuclear borders, pale to foamy  cytoplasm, prominent \"\nnucleoli, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic  cytoplasm arranged in glands and nests. Scattered mitotic figures are  present. These morphologic findings are compatible with adenocarcinoma.  By report, a prior cytology specimen showed tumor cells that stained  with TTF-1, although this case was not provided for our review.  Additional molecular studies were performed by Integrated Oncology and  reported as follows:      -FISH for *****: Negative for ***** gene rearrangement.   -PDL-1:          <1%; interpreted as no expression. -FISH for ALK:       No evidence of ALK gene rearrangement.   -EGFR:          Negative for EGFR mutation.      The morphologic features are of metastatic adenocarcinoma.      In case *****-*****-*****, sections of the tumor in part A show an invasive  tumor composed of epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli and moderate  eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in glands containing necrotic debris.  Scattered mitotic figures are present. The tumor invades muscularis  propria       Provided immunohistochemical stains performed at the original  institution on block A8 and evaluated at ***** are as follows:  -CK7:          Negative.   -*****:          Positive.   -*****:      Positive.        -TTF-1:      Patchy positive.   -Napsin-A:     Negative.   -CD56:          Negative.     The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with an  adenocarcinoma of colorectal primary.      In *****-*****-***** part C, sections of the resection shows a tumor composed  of nested cells with regular nuclear contours, coarse chromatin, and  variably prominent nucleoli. Areas of necrosis are present. This tumor  appears to invade through the muscularis propria and into pericolonic  fat (slide C7).     Immunohistochemical stains performed at the original institution and  evaluated at ***** are as follows:  Block C7:   -CK7:           Positive.   -*****:           Negative.   -CD56:      Negative.   -*****:       \"\nNegative.   -TTF-1:          Negative.     Block C8:  -TTF-1:          Patchy positive.   -Napsin A:      Patchy positive.   -*****:          Negative.   -GATA3:      Negative.   -ER:          Negative.   -*****:          Negative.     Block *****:   -TTF-1:          Focal positive.   -Napsin A:      Focal positive.     The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with an  adenocarcinoma of lung primary.     In *****-*****-***** part E, sections of the left groin lymph node shows  metastatic adenocarcinoma.     Immunohistochemical stains performed at the original institution and  evaluated at ***** block ***** are as follows:   -CK7:           Positive.   -*****:           Negative.   -CD56:      Negative.   -*****:      Negative.   -TTF-1:          Patchy positive.   -Napsin A:     Patchy positive.    The tumor in this lymph node is consistent with metastatic pulmonary  adenocarcinoma.         Colon/Rectum Carcinoma Synoptic  Procedure:  Low anterior resection.  Location of tumor:  Rectum, per report.   Tumor size:  2.8 cm in greatest dimension.   Macroscopic tumor perforation:  Not identified.   Macroscopic Intactness of Mesorectum: Intact.  Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma.   Histologic Grade: G2, moderately differentiated.    Microscopic depth of invasion:  Tumor invades muscularis propria (pT2).  Margins:  Negative.        Proximal margin: Negative (tumor is 4.3 cm from margin per report).         Distal margin: Negative (tumor is 4.2 cm from margin per report)       Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative (tumor is greater than  0.5 cm from margin)        Mesenteric margin: Negative (tumor is 10 cm from margin per report)  Treatment effect (modified ***** score, scale 0-3): No known presurgical  therapy.

Discussed plan of care with hospice RN    Hallucinations  Weakness  New to Me, sudden onset visual hallucinations that are not particularly distressing with significant functional decline (requiring maximal \"\nassistance with transfers/bed mobility), and periods where she stops speaking/gets more confused.  Am concerned this may represent new intracranial metastases and possible seizures.  Less likely though possible medication effect (baclofen).  No benefit with anti-psychotics other than sedation  - extensive discussion with pt, family, and hospice RN regarding suspected cause of decline  - continue supportive care, anticipate need for continuous bed care now   - trial dexamethasone 4mg daily given possible intracranial metastases, monitor glucose closely   - start keppra 500mg BID for possible seizures  - continue seroquel as needed, though will defer for now as hallucinations not particularly distressing at this time  - taper baclofen    Cancer related pain  Osteoarthritis  Established, stable/severe.  H/o chronic low back pain presumed November 11 DDD and OA, moderately controlled with current regimen of topical agents, acetaminophen, and nortriptyline, though pain does limit function and sleep.  Mild discomfort at location of new osseous metastases in upper thoracic spine and increased pain over low back.  Nortriptyline stopped after recent admission related to urinary retention.  Some improvement in neuropathy with gabapentin.      Medication management with:   - continue topical agents (blue emu, topical lidocaine)  - continue acetaminophen 1000mg TID  - continue msir 7.5-15mg q6h PRN, may benefit from scheduled doses starting with 7.5mg qam/noon/dinner and 15mg at bedtime, will adjust as needed  - resume baclofen taper given increasing hallucinations    Counseled regarding non-pharmacologic pain management including use of heat/ice    High-Risk Medication Use:  Opioids  ? Extensive discussion on the risks and benefits of opioids for pain, and strategies to minimize risks and maximize benefits  ? Discussion on maximizing function as the goal of treatment  ? Medication written with maximum 30-day quantity specified and \"\n***** of *****.3 (or other)  ? Plan for ongoing, periodic review of opioid treatment plan  ? CURES database checked as per California law  ? I reviewed the patient’s substance use history as well as current medication list.  Patient does not meet criteria for naloxone prescription. This has been prescribed and patient/caregiver has been educated about appropriate use.  ? Information about how to use opioids safely and effectively and agreements about prescribing given verbally, and in the AVS when appropriate.       Cough  Shortness of breath  Established, worse.  Increased cough/hypoxia without significant shortness of breath or increased work of breathing.  May be component of volume overload related to holding lasix.    - continue supplemental oxygen  - continue opioids as above       Slow transit constipation   Established, stable, November 11 slow transit and opioids  - continue fluids  - continue to titrate senna December 12 BID   - continue miralax daily           Advanced Care Planning/ Advance Care Planning   - enrolled with ***** for hospice, will continue to coordinate care                 Time Spent  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.        I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.                   Return in about 1 week (around 04/20/2022). will \"\ncoordinate with hospice RN    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (***** ***** mutation, also mutations in  *****, KEAP1, and SETD2), here for follow up.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  Stage IV with brain, lymph node, colon metastases. She is s/p multiple prior lines of therapy including L \"\nVATS and pleurodesis, SRS to R parietal met, *****, one cycle pemetrexed (c/b allergic reaction), 4 cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel, and most recently sotorasib. Unfortunately, restaging scans show progression of her cancer. She was not consistently taking the sotorasib due to nausea and trouble keeping down the pills. So might be possible to retrial sotorasib in the future. However, agree it is not the best option at this time. Agree with her local oncologist's plan to initiate gemcitabine asap. I will refer her to our phase I clinic to talk through potential clinical trial options, given that she does have a number of mutations on NGS including ***** *****. We don't have a trial open currently within our lung group for patients with ***** ***** mutations whose cancer progresses despite sotorasib. Unfortunately rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosis ***** this year may be a barrier to trial enrollment, but definitely worth exploring in parallel with starting chemotherapy.     - Agree with starting gemcitabine now as next line of therapy  - Referral to phase I to discuss clinical trial options (ordered) at the time of progression on gemcitabine  - Diagnosis confirmed by ***** path review  - We have requested the images from her recent scans to be sent to ***** for our records.   - Could potentially revisit sotorasib again in the future as she was unable to consistently take it due to nausea, so not a clear failure of treatment -- although given progression, regardless of the cause I agree with switching therapy     #Abdominal pain  - Continue management with her local palliative care team; they are working with her closely on her plan which includes fentanyl, cymbalta, dilaudid prn, tylenol   - Etiology likely progressive retroperitoneal LN metastases plus intestinal implants; agree with switching systemic therapy at this point given progression on restaging scans  - 2nd celiac block could be tried  - We had also discussed \"\npalliative radiation to her RP lymph nodes, but given more widespread progression would favor switch in systemic therapy    #Supportive care:  Low energy - ritalin prescribed by palliative care, periodic transfusions  Nausea - compazine, sucralfate, and ativan prn  Lactulose and bisacodyl for constipation     RTC as needed at times of decisions     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 35 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.      \"\n"},

Imaging result in interval history above.     No interval imaging.  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We discussed previously that the ***** ***** mutation can be targeted with sotorasib, but that this treatment is only approved in the 2L. Dr. ***** did briefly discuss the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started \"\ncarboplatin/pemetrexed 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection, and short interval follow up CT scans in about 2 months.      Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. Dr. ***** had discussed these results over the phone with her and reviewed her imaging again in clinic. At this juncture we recommended changing systemic treatment. She preferred a break from infusion and visits to the city, so she started sotorasib alone. We discussed the side effects of sotorasib in detail including nausea, diarrhea, and liver injury, the latter of which rarely can be severe. She did not tolerate it all that well due to diarrhea and GI side effects, and unfortunately scans from 11/09/2022 showed progression despite sotorasib. So she was switched most recently to gemcitabine.      Finally, I discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, she notes slightly worse than baseline lower extremity edema, R>L and pain in ***** (R>L). She has known occlusions. Diarrhea \"\nis better since stopping sotorasib. LFT abnormalities on December 13 were most likely due to sotorasib; she has stopped this treatment so hopefully will improve but need to CTM closely.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. We discussed a few options for next treatment, including SoC chemotherapy with either docetaxel or gemcitabine versus attempting to get insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial in phase I focused on ***** mutations. Her preference at this time is for gemcitabine to minimize side effects/toxicity.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   - Just started gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now to ensure tolerability, if she does well can switch to day 1, 8, and 15 day dosing of q28 day cycles -- see is being treated locally with Dr. *****   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age); versus trial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase \"\nI trial focused on *****  -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   - Future scans locally  - CT C/A/P locally 6 weeks after starting gemcitabine      #LFT abnormalities  New transaminitis on 12/13/2022 labs. Suspect sotorasib-induced hepatotoxicity, which can be severe particularly following ***** pembrolizumab exposure. She stopped sotorasib on 12/08/2022 so hopefully that will help. Need to CTM closely.  - I would suggest getting labs a bit more frequently for now (every 1-2 weeks) to ensure trajectory improves      #Lower extremity edema   - Worse than baseline per patient, with pain (R>L). Not on AC per patient and chart. Follow up DVT ultrasound on 10/27/2022 without DVT.   - CTM     #Mucus membrane pemphigoid  Lesions most severe in mouth and nasal cavity, no involvement of her eyes. Histopathologically confirmed. Minimal response to rituximab on 10/29/21 and 11/05/2021, also s/p prolonged prednisone taper.  -Off prednisone altogether as of 03/19/2022 without recent flares; overall mouth symptoms are much better.   -Also now off dapsone  -She has   -Taking ***** ***** supplement   -Follow up with dermatology as scheduled and coordinate her care with them closely.     #Brain mets  One small parietal lesion concerning for a met and one in the putamen that were treated with GK on 02/26/2022.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. male with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 1%) with pleural and bone metastases, s/p carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab x2 cycles with stable lung mass but possibly worsening subcutaneous metastases (although disease burden fairly stable overall on chemo), now on sotorasib. Here for a second opinion about management.      We discussed the pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma based on review of his lymph node biopsies. The morphology and IHC staining pattern was not specific for a site of origin. The morphology with abundant mucin and signet ring features is often associated with upper GI primaries but also can be found in pulmonary adenocarcinomas; and IHC \"\nstaining pattern was not specific with CK7+ but negative for TTF-1 and *****. Ultimately, given radiographic pattern of spread and a negative recent EGD, presumed primary is the lungs. Internal UCSF pathology review done, agree with diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma and favor pulmonary primary. Foundation NGS revealed a ***** ***** mutation, which is also consistent with lung site of origin.      We then discussed staging. Based on pleural and bone involvement on PET scans, the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We then discussed treatment options. I noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. Without diagnosed activating mutations, he was approximately started on platinum based *****; local oncologist started with carboplatin and ***** (given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens) plus pembrolizumab. Restaging PET scan after 2 cycles showed a mixed response, with largely stable disease in the lungs but with possible increased FDG uptake in bone and gluteal mets (but no significant progression). However for better tolerability, he was switched to sotorasib given his ***** ***** mutation. We previously reviewed the data today for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). He is tolerating treatment okay with some side effects (e.g. edema). Restaging scans are planned in December to assess intial response.     In the future, treatment options at the time of progression will depend on his performance status and treatment wishes at that time. Could include retrial of chemo and/or CPI or clinical trial (e.g. we have open a clinical trial of sotorasib + docetaxel chemotherapy in later line of treatment after \"\nPD on sotorasib). However it's not clear given deconditioning and frailty whether he will have the performance status for a clinical trial.  I encouraged him to check in around the times of scans in the future to decide on next steps for treatment.      Finally, we discussed supportive care. At this time, bone pain, weight loss, and respiratory symptoms requiring oxygen are his most bothersome symptoms. I've referred him to symptom management and nutritionist at our cancer center to start and he is now plugged in with these specialties. Pain is better managed after radiation, delirium is better of opiates. I encouraged him to be forthcoming about new symptoms as they arise.      #Stage IV adenocarcinoma  Suspected lung primary, but morphology and IHC staining is not entirely specific per local path review and could be consistent with either a lung or an upper GI primary. Foundation NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 1%. Pleural and bone mets at diagnosis, requiring 4L NC O2. He is s/p 2 cycles carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** with largely stable disease. Then switched to sotorasib for possible early PD in subcutaneous metastases and better tolerability.   - UCSF internal path review to try to confirm diagnosis done  - Formal UCSF radiology overread requested on PET/CT from 10/02/2021 suggest his disease largely stable on 2 cycles carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** other than isolated gluteal met  - For now, continue sotorasib for ***** *****.  - Agree with scans in December to determine initiation response and to help follow up on some of his symptoms   - Follow up as needed moving forward around the times of scans (next after week of 12/23/2021)      #Pleural effusion  Now has pleurX catheter in place, he is draining about *****-***** cc a week. CTM output.     #Bone metastases  We discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents \"\nto reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. He has recently been started on denosumab by local oncologist. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic. He's had a course of RT to several painful bony mets including R scapula and thoracic spine.   - Agree with denosumab  - Continue norco prn typically 3x a day     #COPD  Recent diagnosis, due to DLCo severely reduced at 28% predicted. Not entirely clear if this is due to emphysema or if there is also a component due to lymphangitic spread of cancer. He is now on supplemental oxygen, 3.5L NC. Some relief with nebulizer treatments.  - Formoterol, budesonide, and atrovent BID     #SSS  S/p PPM for symptomatic bradycardia. Unfortunately he can't get MRI brain as a result.      #AFlutter  He is on eliquis 5 mg    #Supportive care  Anxiety - panic attacks worsened in the setting of stress over diagnosis. Followed by psychiatry who is helping adjust his medications. Continue seroquel.   Delirium: wife and patient report improved after stopping opiates and gabapentin   Insomnia: continue melatonin   Edema: may be side effect of sotorasib, if asymmetric get DVT ultrasound, follow up restaging scans     RTC the week of of December 31 after scans locally the week prior    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's \"\nrecords and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.    \"\n"},

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment: \"\n    Impression: ***** y.o. male with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma (***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 1%) with pleural and bone metastases, s/p carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab x2 cycles with stable lung mass but possibly worsening subcutaneous metastases (although disease burden fairly stable overall on chemo), now on sotorasib. Here for a second opinion about management.      We discussed the pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma based on review of his lymph node biopsies. The morphology and IHC staining pattern was not specific for a site of origin. The morphology with abundant mucin and signet ring features is often associated with upper GI primaries but also can be found in pulmonary adenocarcinomas; and IHC staining pattern was not specific, with CK7+ but negative for TTF-1 and *****. Ultimately, given radiographic pattern of spread and a negative recent EGD, presumed primary is the lungs. Internal UCSF pathology review done, agree with diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma and favor pulmonary primary. Foundation NGS revealed a ***** ***** mutation, which is also consistent with lung site of origin.      We then discussed staging. Based on pleural and bone involvement on PET scans, the patient has stage IV disease. We discussed the fact that stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We then discussed treatment options. I noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. Without diagnosed activating mutations, he was approximately started on platinum based *****; local oncologist started with carboplatin and ***** (given efficacy and less toxicity than other regimens) plus pembrolizumab. Restaging PET scan after 2 cycles showed a mixed response, with largely stable disease in the lungs but with possible increased FDG uptake in bone and gluteal mets (but no significant \"\nprogression). However for better tolerability, he was switched to sotorasib given his ***** ***** mutation. We previously reviewed the data today for sotorasib in the 2L setting for patients with ***** ***** mutated NSCLC, with an ***** of 37.1% and median ***** of 11.1 months (***** et al. ***** 2021). He is tolerating treatment okay with some side effects (e.g. edema).     Today we reviewed the reports from his most recent restaging scans from 12/23/2021. Overall burden of prior metastatic disease is fairly stable on sotorasib, but there is some concern about interval new left lung pulmonary nodules. I will review his scans at thoracic tumor board next week after we obtain the scan images to determine level of suspicion for cancer progression. In the future, treatment options at the time of documented progression will depend on his performance status and treatment wishes at that time. Could include retrial of chemo and/or CPI or clinical trial. Unfortunately our current trials are only enrolling patients who have not been treated yet with sotorasib, but we may soon have open subsequent line trial for patients after sotorasib. I could also refer him to our phase I group to discuss any available trials. His performance status has improved so it's possible he would be a trial candidate. Until there is clear progression, however, I would continue sotorasib and image with short interval scans every 2-3 months.      Finally, we discussed supportive care. At this time, bone pain, weight loss, and respiratory symptoms requiring oxygen are his most bothersome symptoms. I've referred him to symptom management and nutritionist at our cancer center to start and he is now plugged in with these specialties. Pain is better managed after radiation, delirium is better off opiates. I encouraged him to be forthcoming about new symptoms as they arise.      #Stage IV adenocarcinoma  Suspected lung primary, but morphology and IHC staining is \"\nnot entirely specific per local path review and could be consistent with either a lung or an upper GI primary. Foundation NGS with ***** ***** mutation, PD-L1 1%. Pleural and bone mets at diagnosis, requiring 4L NC O2. He is s/p 2 cycles carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** with largely stable disease. Then switched to sotorasib for possible early PD in subcutaneous metastases and better tolerability. Recent PET scans are largely stable but with new left-sided pulmonary nodules potentially worrisome for malignancy vs infection.   - UCSF internal path review to try to confirm diagnosis done  - Formal UCSF radiology overread requested on PET/CT from 10/02/2021 suggest his disease largely stable on 2 cycles carboplatin, pemetrexed, ***** other than isolated gluteal met  - I will review PET/CT from 12/23/2021 (after we obtain images) at our thoracic tumor board to determine whether the left-sided nodules are worrisome for progression   - For now, continue sotorasib for ***** ***** in the absence of clear progression with follow up CT scans in 2-3 months  - Follow up around the times of scans     #Pleural effusion  Now has pleurX catheter in place, he is draining about *****-***** a week. CTM output which may have picked up a bit recently.     #Bone metastases  We discussed that bone metastatic disease is more prone to fracture that can cause loss of function and/or pain. I recommend use of bone-modifying agents to reduce the risk of fracture, either denosumab or ***** acid q3-4wks x 1 year, then q3mo thereafter. He has recently been started on denosumab by local oncologist. I also recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation at standard doses. We briefly discussed the phenomenon where at initial restaging on treatment there can emergence of \"new\" bone mets that more likely represent sclerotic response to treatment in microscopic tumors that become macroscopic. He's had a course of RT to several painful bony mets including R \"\nscapula and thoracic spine.   - Agree with denosumab  - Continue norco prn typically 3x a day     #COPD  Recent diagnosis, due to DLCo severely reduced at 28% predicted. Not entirely clear if this is due to emphysema or if there is also a component due to lymphangitic spread of cancer. He is now on supplemental oxygen, 3.5L NC. Some relief with nebulizer treatments.  - Formoterol, budesonide, and atrovent BID; but hard to tell how much they help symptoms     #SSS  S/p PPM for symptomatic bradycardia. Unfortunately he can't get MRI brain as a result.      #AFlutter  He is on eliquis 5 mg BID.     #Supportive care  Anxiety - panic attacks worsened in the setting of stress over diagnosis. Followed by psychiatry who is helping adjust his medications. Continue seroquel.   Delirium: wife and patient report improved after stopping opiates and gabapentin   Insomnia: continue melatonin   Edema: may be side effect of sotorasib, if asymmetric get DVT ultrasound, follow up restaging scans     RTC in 2-3 months after scans, I will call him after tumor board next week    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and \"\n"},

Hypermetabolic, spiculated left upper lobe node measuring up to 2.8 cm most compatible with primary malignancy. Recommend histopathologic correlation. Hypermetabolism within the uterine fundus is nonspecific; correlate with prior imaging or dedicate pelvic ultrasound as clinically indicated.   -08/14/20 PET/CT: Enlarging aorticopulmonary window lymph node without significant hypermetabolism. While the lack of FDG avidity is reassuring, this lymph node remains indeterminate for metastatic disease; attention on follow-up. Given differences in cerebellar SUV, no significant change in hypermetabolism of primary left upper lobe mass. Slight increased size with increased surrounding groundglass opacity could reflect interval radiation therapy; correlate with history. No new sites of disease. Enhancing focus in the uterine fundus with persistent hypermetabolism compared to 06/05/2020 may represent concurrent endometrial cancer. It could be further evaluated with pelvic MRI or ultrasound as clinically indicated.  -09/08/20 Completed SBRT (50 Gy in 5 fractions)  -11/28/20 CT chest: Decreased size of left upper lobe mass with evolving post-radiation changes. New lytic lesions in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, concerning for osseous metastatic disease.  -12/05/20 PET/CT: Compared to 08/14/2020, new hypermetabolic lytic lesions in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, most \"\nseen by Dr. ***** (*****), no trials open right now but can reach out if things change   - future tx options could include trial vs. Irinotecan.

Additional hypermetabolic focus in the distal right clavicle without a definite CT correlate, which could represent an additional osseous metastasis. Recommend attention on follow-up. Decreased size and hypermetabolism of the left upper lobe primary pulmonary malignancy and aortopulmonary window lymph node. Unchanged enhancing hypermetabolic lesion in the uterine fundus, incompletely evaluated on this exam, but could represent a concurrent endometrial malignancy.

Slightly increased size of juxtapleural and fissural nodules in the left upper lobe, which are indeterminate for metastases. Increased cortical irregularity of the left ischial tuberosity with new enhancement and fluid in the regions of the hamstrings tendon.

Findings are concerning for recurrent disease with nodal metastasis. New/significant increased size of left pleural lesions, which appear to be contiguous with the left upper lobe mass however do not demonstrate hypermetabolism. Findings remain suspicious for pleural metastasis verses loculated pleural fluid. Increased size of small left pleural effusion, suspicious for malignant effusion. Interval resolution of hypermetabolism of T7 and T8 vertebral bodies compatible with treatment response. Compared to 02/26/2021, increased size of left sacral lesion with \"\ninterval resolution of hypermetabolism. This may represent treatment response versus a false negative PET/CT. Interlobular septal thickening and groundglass opacities most predominant in the left upper lobe is favored to represent pulmonary edema due to lymphatic obstruction and likely superimposed infection/atelectasis due to narrowing and partial obstruction of the more distal left upper lobe airways.   - 09/23/21: ***** discussion- recommended biopsy given c/f disease progression  - 10/08/21-10/13/21: Admitted to UCSF after presenting w/ intractable nausea/vomiting, concurrently endorses worsening shortness of breath.                - underwent pleurx placement for recurrent *****               - October 11 MRI Brain: *****  -10/19/21: CT guided FNA *****, path positive for adenocarcinoma. ***** with ***** *****  - 11/18/21 CT chest: 1.

Progression after C4 carbo/pemetrexed/*****. Started sotorasib 06/11/21. Interval scans with overall treatment response, although with one pleural nodule slightly increased in size (7 to 11 mm). 09/16/2021 imaging showed worsening of the ***** masslike consolidation (now 6.9x6.1 cm, previously 3.7 x 1.6 cm), A/P window node slightly increased, increased L pleural effusion but bone mets are not avid (thought may be affected by T1DM). Underwent lung biopsy on 10/19/21, ***** showed ***** ***** (and ***** mutation). Repeat CT c/a/p 11/18/21 show  decreased size of ***** mass compared to September 29 imaging, surprising given no change in treatment. Discussed at *****. Since November 2021 imaging is still substantially progressed compared to July 2021, recommendation is for change of therapy. Discussed options including single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine vs taxane) vs clinical trial vs continuing sotorasib since disease did improve slightly from September to November. Pt has underlying neuropathy from diabetes so not a good candidate for taxane. In shared decision-making, elected to pursue gemcitabine D1/*****.    C1 week 1 with nausea, fatigue, ***** thrombocytopenia thus dose reduced ***** to 75 mg/m2 with significant improvement in symptoms.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No interval imaging.  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)    None             Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      Dr. ***** previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      Dr. ***** then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV \"\n(*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     Dr. ***** previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We discussed previously that the ***** ***** mutation can be targeted with sotorasib, but that this treatment is only approved in the 2L. Dr. ***** did briefly discuss the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, Dr. ***** recommended carboplatin/pemetrexed based therapy given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. Ordinarily, given PD-L1 of 10%  would typically recommend combination of chemo plus pembrolizumab in a fit and healthy person. Despite her age, ***** has excellent PS for this aggressive treatment, and Dr. ***** discussed with her dermatologists who recommend prioritizing her cancer therapy and have ***** ***** pembrolizumab in her treatment regimen. Her MMP is much improved and they believed she can be managed through an exacerbation if needed. They have weaned down her prednisone significantly to now 5 mg/day (with plans to wean even further).    CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. She is tolerating therapy reasonably well. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. It was planned to switch to maintenance treatment. She started pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side \"\neffects.     Previously Dr. ***** reviewed CT scans from 06/22/2022. Overall there has been improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. There are several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size, however. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. They are all generally <1 cm in size. Dr. ***** discussed with ***** treating with course of abx for possible infection, and short interval follow up CT scans in about 2 months. In the meantime, will continue with current therapy (pemetrexed + pembrolizumab).    Most recently, Dr. ***** reviewed repeat staging CT C/A/P which unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. Dr. ***** had discussed these results over the phone with her and reviewed her imaging again in clinic. At this juncture it is recommended changing systemic treatment. The first option would be to pursue sotorasib which is SOC for 2L treatment for kras ***** mutated lung cancer. The second would be to consider ***** clinical trial- we have a second line option that combines sotorasib with docetaxel. Her performance status is more borderline now compared to prior to carbo/pem/***** start with some functional decline and it was discussed that toxicities of the combination may be significant. She also prefers a break from infusion and visits to the city so we agreed to defer the trial and pursue sotorasib alone. It was discussed the side effects of sotorasib in detail including nausea, diarrhea, and liver injury, the latter of which rarely can be severe. It counseled to avoid alcohol or excessive tylenol use. Dr. ***** also reviewed median PFS of sotorasib was ~February 21 mo based on available evidence from *****/*****.     Finally, Dr. ***** discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, she notes slightly \"\nworse than baseline lower extremity edema, R>L and pain in ***** (R>L). She has known occlusions. ***** has been improving since stopping chemotherapy, and overall \"feels great\".    #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed significant disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules.   -Stop pemetrexed/*****  -Start sotorasib 960 mg daily, delivered 09/23/22 --> started 09/27/22  -Future lines of tx include gemcitabine monotherapy vs docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age)  -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   - Future scans locally     - CT C/A/P 6 weeks after starting sotorasib (Locally November 09)  - ***** have labs locally tomorrow (10/27/22)      #Lower extremity edema  - Worse than baseline per patient, with pain (R>L).

Left pleural circumferential nodular and necrotic thickening appears grossly similar although the largest single nodule which appears to erode through the chest wall and through the anterior aspect of the left sixth rib appears slightly increased in size, this may be due to increase conspicuity given differences in phase of contrast between the 2 studies rather than a true increase in size. 3.

Postsurgical changes related to right hemithyroidectomy with residual left thyroid gland identified along the inferior and left lateral margin of the flap reconstruction.   Previously seen centrally necrotic nodule along the right sternocleidomastoid has increased in size now measuring approximately 1.4 cm (previously 1 cm).  ***** changes of bilateral neck dissection with small left level 2 lymph nodes appearing unchanged from priors. No new or progressive cervical adenopathy.  No fluid collection in the neck.  Postsurgical changes from remote left frontal sinus surgery appears similar to priors. Persistent opacification of the residual left frontal sinus. Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Cervical carotid and vertebral arteries are patent. No high-grade stenosis. Internal jugular veins are patent with mild stenosis of the upper left internal jugular vein due to extrinsic mass effect from the transverse process of C1.  Progressive osseous mets new lucency along the right inferior aspect of the C7 vertebral body with progression of disease in the thoracic vertebral bodies, please see separately dictate chest CT report.    Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine most notable spanning C5-C7 with severe right C5-6 neural foraminal stenosis, \"\nunchanged. No high-grade bony canal stenosis.   Multiple enhancing intracranial ***** and osseous metastases are partially visualized and better characterized on the MRI brain dated 07/02/2021.   Chest findings are reported separately.   IMPRESSION:    1.  Compared with 05/25/2021, interval increase in size of right sternocleidomastoid muscle nodular metastatic disease, now measuring up to 1.4 cm, previously 1 cm.  2.  New lytic lesion along the inferior aspect of the C7 vertebral body, suspicious for an osseous metastasis. Progression of osseous metastasis in the thoracic spine is separately reported, please see chest CT for details.     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST    LUNGS:  Some of peribronchovascular thickening throughout the left lung with multiple small left pulmonary nodules. No evidence of new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. Slightly increased right basilar atelectasis.   PLEURA:  Similar appearance of loculated right pleural effusion with largest single loculated component in the posterior left pleura measuring 5.3 x 4.9 x 11.5 cm (***** x AP x CC) with additional large loculated component at the inferior aspect of the left pleura. Circumferential nodular thickening of the left pleura with multiple necrotic nodules including a necrotic lesion that extends from the pleura and erodes the anterior left sixth rib and measures approximately 23 x 25 mm in greatest axial dimension (series 3, image *****) which appears similar to slightly increased in size compared from prior although this may be due to differences in phase of contrast.   Slightly increased trace right pleural effusion.   MEDIASTINUM:   Similar appearance of mediastinal lymphadenopathy for example a low right paraesophageal lymph node (series 3, image *****) measures approximately 10 mm in shortest axis and a necrotic prevascular lymph node (series 3, image *****) which measures 12 x 16 mm which are unchanged from prior when measured in similar \"\nfashion.   HEART/***** *****:  Unchanged heart size.

Compared to 05/25/2021, no significant change in large loculated left pleural effusion.   2.  Left pleural circumferential nodular and necrotic thickening appears grossly similar although the largest single nodule which appears to erode through the chest wall and through the anterior aspect of the left sixth rib appears slightly increased in size, this may be due to increase conspicuity given differences in phase of contrast between the 2 studies rather than a true increase in size.   3.  Increased small focus of sclerosis in the T9 vertebral body which may reflect a sclerotic osseous metastasis versus a treated osseous lesion.   4.  Unchanged left lung pulmonary nodules and peribronchovascular soft tissue thickening likely related to lymphangitic and pulmonary parenchymal metastatic disease.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No interval imaging.  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)               01/14/23 0000  MR Brain with and without Contrast (Storage Only) Final result    Narrative:  This is a study performed outside UCSF and stored for the purposes of    comparison as requested by  Not In System Radiology Provider.                Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node \"\n(which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly \"\nwith lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it much better so far. ***** we reviewed MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****. CT scan anticipated in the next few weeks.      Finally, I discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, she notes slightly worse than baseline lower extremity edema, R>L and pain in ***** (R>L). She has known occlusions in arteries in legs. Diarrhea is better since stopping sotorasib.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. ***** the line, could consider docetaxel, requesting insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial in phase I focused on ***** mutations.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   - Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- see is being treated locally with Dr. *****   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age); versus \"\ntrial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase I trial focused on *****  -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   - Future scans locally  - CT C/A/P locally in 3-4 weeks to assess initial response      #LFT abnormalities  New transaminitis on 12/13/2022 labs. Suspect sotorasib-induced hepatotoxicity, which can be severe particularly following ***** pembrolizumab exposure. She stopped sotorasib on 12/08/2022 so hopefully that will help. Now resolved.     #Lower extremity edema   - Worse than baseline per patient, with pain (R>L). Not on AC per patient and chart. Follow up DVT ultrasound on 10/27/2022 without DVT.   - CTM     #Mucus membrane pemphigoid  Lesions most severe in mouth and nasal cavity, no involvement of her eyes. Histopathologically confirmed. Minimal response to rituximab on 10/29/21 and 11/05/2021, also s/p prolonged prednisone taper.  -Off prednisone altogether as of 03/19/2022 without recent flares; overall mouth symptoms are much better.   -Also now off dapsone  -Taking ***** ***** supplement   -Follow up with dermatology as scheduled and coordinate her care with them closely.     #Brain mets  One small parietal lesion concerning for a met and one in the putamen that were treated with GK on 02/26/2022. Prior MRI had a question about two cerebellar lesions that were less definitive. No changes on last MRI from 01/14/2023.  -cont MRI brain q3mo, next due in late March 2023   - Note: Headaches recently, mild. Improves with advil/tylenol. Has hx chronic neck injuries. Some mild blurry vision, was planning to see optometrist. CTM and contact us if ***** worsens or vision changes.     #Tachycardia  Not clear whether this is sinus tachycardia or arrhythmia. Normal LVEF on TTE (60-65%) from 05/07/2022.  - Follow by Dr. *****, recently had ***** Patch.     #Supportive care  -SMS to *****-pal clinic for co-management (Saw SMS February 2022, ***** February 06), no follow up scheduled.  -Nutrition - Reports 2-*****/day, weight \"\nstable.  -PT referral for balance, strength training given prior *****  -Increasing work/taking on a new client in the coming weeks. Still teaching yoga classes.  -Constipation: takes senna BID PRN.     RTC in mid February after next scans locally on gemcitabine     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction.

My interpretation as in ***** above.    Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with history of well-controlled HIV, rectal cancer under the care of Dr. ***** s/p FOLFOX, chemo-rads (March 2018) and June (May 2019) and \"\nStage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (PD-L1 high, ***** *****+, hyper-mutated) s/p RLL wedge resection with Dr. ***** (July 2018) with biopsy confirmed metastatic recurrence in August 2019 s/p 4 cycles *****/Pem/Keytruda then  Pem/Keytruda maintenance then ipi/***** then docetaxel who presents today in follow up on *****.      # NSCLC.     Initially diagnosed in 2019 with Stage IIIA lung adeno in setting of con-current Rectal Cancer (under the care of Dr. *****).  She underwent resection with Dr. ***** in 2019 with metastatic recurrence (b/l pulmonary nodules) in the ***** ***** *****.  It is unclear if she has metastatic involvement of her lung outside her thorax vs rectal cancer.  It is concerning that she has persistent APC and ***** ***** mutations in her blood (her lung CA is ***** *****+ and does not harbor an APC mutation).  She did quite well with 1L treatment for metastatic lung adeno with carbo/pem/*****, but only maintained disease control for a short period on pem/***** maintenance.   We attempted to control her disease with combined CTLA4/PD1 inhibition, however scans after 2 months show complete failure to control her disease with perhaps a hyper-progressor phenotype.  This is quite disappointing given her high TMB and *****.  We discussed hospice; however she elected to pursue 2nd chemotherapy (taxane).  She has tolerated this poorly and interval imaging shows continued rapid disease progression.    We had a frank discussion today about her options at that time.  Giver her declining performance status and rapid progression we recommended hospice but were willing to try ***** targeted therapy as it generally well tolerated.  Unfortunately she has continued to decline with worsening PS and her ***** did not identify a ***** mutation. Given this information we discussed that additional cancer targeted therapies are unlikely to improve her quality of life or provide meaningful extension in length of life and we strongly \"\nrecommended she enroll in hospice to provide access to the care and services she will require going forward.      After a lengthy discussion, ***** and her niece agreed with this plan and we will enroll in ***** tonight.    # Rectal adenocarcinoma  - *****, s/p neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by June with end colostomy 08/19/2019 restaging scan demonstrating sub-diaphragmatic ***** ***** concerning for recurrence.  This have not been amenable to biopsy so far but with disease progression they may be.  However, given pace of progression and limited treatment options for her lung CA I'm not sure if it will provide useful information.  Taxane unfortunately likely has limited activity against rectal cancer.  An alternative nth line regimen with better activity against both would be irinotecan.    #tracheal/bronchial invasion  - right middle lobe bronchus now nearly occluded, no symptoms, no hemoptysis,  - CTM closely, given overall health unlikely to benefit from stenting.    #hydro-ureter/nephrosis (moderate)  - slightly worse but unilateral.  - renal function holding steady  - again given tumor burden and pace unclear if benefit from stenting.    #LE Edema,  -Unilateral, Chronic.  Suspect relationship to prior June, rectal cancer LN involvement, ? stoma  -Repeat U/S negative for clot and demonstrates persistent edema.  -Referred to ***** clinic.  -Encourage compression stockings, elevation of leg  -Appreciate SMS assistance with pain managment,      # Colostomy and stoma hernia  - some increased swelling, pain,  - working with ***** *****, for stoma care instructions and monitoring.    # Depression and Anxiety   - continue to follow up with SMS     #HIV   - currently controlled with ***** with undetectable virus level  - repeat labs    # Neuropathy   - pt to continue current regimen with gabapentin    # Fatigue   - stable, ctm    # Supportive care.

Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)                 06/07/23 0000  CT Chest Abdomen Pelvis with Contrast (Storage Only) Final result    Narrative:  This is a study performed outside UCSF and stored for the purposes of    comparison as requested by  \"\nNot In System Radiology Provider.                  Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated \"\nit okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it better so far. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****.     First set of restaging scans from 03/11/2023 on gemcitabine were overall stable to improved pulmonary nodules, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy and no clear new sites of disease. Single nodule in ***** may have increased slightly in size but overall improvement in disease. Today, we reviewed images from ***** c/a/p from 06/07/2023 which is stable overall. Continue gemcitabine q2 weeks and will plan for next CT scans in ~12 weeks. Recent cycles tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril, ***** much improved. Olanzapine also seems to have helped nausea. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed compression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs. Diarrhea is better since stopping sotorasib.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with \"\ntreatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. CT scans from 03/11/2023 stable to improved overall. Today, we discussed 06/07/2023 scans which are stable per report; images not yet available. Continue q2 week gemcitabine for now. ***** the line, could consider docetaxel, requesting insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial in phase I focused on ***** mutations.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   -Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- see is being treated locally with Dr. *****   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age); versus trial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase I trial focused on *****  -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   - Future scans locally  - CT c/a/p from 03/11/2023 looks good, overall improvement in pulmonary nodules and LN, CTM ***** nodule  - CT c/a/p from 06/07/2023 stable per report, we have requested images to confirm   - Gemcitabine is more tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril given severe headaches post-treatment, and if needed for nausea, add olanzapine 5-10 mg at bedtime    - Next CT C/A/P locally in 12 weeks  - CTM ***** type symptoms -- letter to stay home from work \"\nthis week while still potentially contagious and symptomatic     #Lower extremity edema   - Worse than baseline per patient, with pain (R>L).

Hypermetabolic, spiculated left upper lobe node measuring up to 2.8 cm most compatible with primary malignancy. Recommend histopathologic correlation. Hypermetabolism within the uterine fundus is nonspecific; correlate with prior imaging or dedicate pelvic ultrasound as clinically indicated.   -08/14/20 PET/CT: Enlarging aorticopulmonary window lymph node without significant hypermetabolism. While the lack of FDG avidity is reassuring, this lymph node remains indeterminate for metastatic disease; attention on follow-up. Given differences in cerebellar SUV, no significant change in hypermetabolism of primary left upper lobe mass. Slight increased size with increased surrounding groundglass opacity could reflect interval radiation therapy; correlate with history. No new sites of disease. Enhancing focus in the uterine fundus with persistent hypermetabolism compared to 06/05/2020 may represent concurrent endometrial cancer. It could be further evaluated with pelvic MRI or ultrasound as clinically indicated.  -09/08/20 Completed SBRT (50 Gy in 5 fractions)  -11/28/20 CT chest: Decreased size of left upper lobe mass with evolving post-radiation changes.

Discuss options including next line of chemotherapy such as irinotecan, clinical trials (of which UCSF and ***** don't have a relevant trial currently), or best supportive care. Given her difficulty with tolerating chemotherapy to date, we are both concerned that further chemo has a high chance of causing side effects with a low chance of benefit.

Below for billing only  I spent a total of 43 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.    \"\nthe T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, most compatible with osseous metastases. Additional hypermetabolic focus in the distal right clavicle without a definite CT correlate, which could represent an additional osseous metastasis. Recommend attention on follow-up. Decreased size and hypermetabolism of the left upper lobe primary pulmonary malignancy and aortopulmonary window lymph node. Unchanged enhancing hypermetabolic lesion in the uterine fundus, incompletely evaluated on this exam, but could represent a concurrent endometrial malignancy.

Findings are concerning for recurrent disease with nodal metastasis. New/significant increased size of left pleural lesions, which appear to be contiguous with the left upper lobe mass however do not demonstrate hypermetabolism. Findings remain suspicious for pleural metastasis verses loculated pleural fluid. Increased size of small left pleural effusion, suspicious for malignant effusion. Interval resolution of hypermetabolism of T7 and T8 vertebral bodies compatible with treatment response. Compared to 02/26/2021, increased \"\nsize of left sacral lesion with interval resolution of hypermetabolism. This may represent treatment response versus a false negative PET/CT. Interlobular septal thickening and groundglass opacities most predominant in the left upper lobe is favored to represent pulmonary edema due to lymphatic obstruction and likely superimposed infection/atelectasis due to narrowing and partial obstruction of the more distal left upper lobe airways.   - 09/23/21: ***** discussion- recommended biopsy given c/f disease progression  - 10/08/21-10/13/21: Admitted to UCSF after presenting w/ intractable nausea/vomiting, concurrently endorses worsening shortness of breath.                - underwent pleurx placement for recurrent *****               - October 11 MRI Brain: *****  -10/19/21: CT guided FNA *****, path positive for adenocarcinoma. ***** with ***** *****  - 11/18/21 CT chest: 1.

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 not tested d/t lack of tissue, initially stage ***** s/p SBRT, now with quick metastatic bony recurrence s/p RT), with progression on \"\ncarboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab, on sotorasib with progression, now on gemcitabine with progression    #Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma: ***** ***** by *****. Original bx unfortunately QNS for PD-L1. April 2021 imaging showed stable disease. Severe delayed nausea with C1 requiring hospitalization was much improved with C2. Progression after C4 carbo/pemetrexed/*****. Started sotorasib 06/11/21. Interval scans with overall treatment response, although with one pleural nodule slightly increased in size (7 to 11 mm). 09/16/2021 imaging showed worsening of the ***** masslike consolidation (now 6.9x6.1 cm, previously 3.7 x 1.6 cm), A/P window node slightly increased, increased L pleural effusion but bone mets are not avid (thought may be affected by T1DM). Underwent lung biopsy on 10/19/21, ***** showed ***** ***** (and ***** mutation). Repeat CT c/a/p 11/18/21 show  decreased size of ***** mass compared to September 29 imaging, surprising given no change in treatment. Discussed at *****. Since November 2021 imaging is still substantially progressed compared to July 2021, recommendation is for change of therapy. Discussed options including single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine vs taxane) vs clinical trial vs continuing sotorasib since disease did improve slightly from September to November. Pt has underlying neuropathy from diabetes so not a good candidate for taxane. In shared decision-making, elected to pursue gemcitabine D1/*****.    C1 week 1 with nausea, fatigue, ***** thrombocytopenia thus dose reduced ***** to 75 mg/m2 with significant improvement in symptoms.    Imaging 01/14/22 after 2 cycles of gemcitabine overall with a mixed response- some pleural nodules and lymph nodes improved, but a few areas of subtle growth (L supraclavicular node, new ***** pulmonary nodule). Given she is tolerating gemcitabine well with limited next line options, we elected to continue with treatment for now and obtain restaging scans after 2 more cycles.    Today, we reviewed her \"\n"},

Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard \"\ntreatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it better so far. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****.     First set of restaging scans from 03/11/2023 on gemcitabine were overall stable to improved pulmonary nodules, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy and no clear new sites of disease. Single nodule in ***** may have increased slightly in size but overall improvement in disease. CT c/a/p from 06/07/2023 stable overall. Continued gemcitabine q2 weeks and will plan for next CT scans in ~12 weeks. Recent cycles tolerable after \"\nswitching from zofran to kytril, ***** much improved. Olanzapine also seems to have helped nausea. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed compression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs. Diarrhea is better since stopping sotorasib.     Today, we reviewed images from ***** c/a/p from 09/13/2023 which are stable. Last gemcitabine infusion on 08/24/2023. She is on a temporary treatment break through 10/25/2023 given some cumulative side effects from nearly 2 years continuous treatment (fatigue, nausea). Feeling a bit better during this break. Plan to resume on 10/25/2023.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. CT scans from 03/11/2023 stable to improved overall. 06/07/2023 scans stable. 09/13/2023 CT scans also stable. Now on a brief gemcitabine break around the holidays due to some cumulative fatigue but plans to restart \"\n10/25/2023.***** the line, could consider docetaxel, requesting insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial in phase I focused on ***** mutations.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   -Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- see is being treated locally with Dr. *****.

Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)                 01/27/24 0000  ***** ***** without Contrast (Storage Only) Final result               Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 \"\ndisease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side \"\neffects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it well overall. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****.     First set of restaging scans from 03/11/2023 on gemcitabine were overall stable to improved pulmonary nodules, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy and no clear new sites of disease. Single nodule in ***** may have increased slightly in size but overall improvement in disease. CT c/a/p from 06/07/2023 stable overall. Continued gemcitabine q2 weeks and will plan for next CT scans in ~12 weeks. Recent cycles tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril, ***** much improved. Olanzapine also seems to have helped nausea. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed compression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs.     CT c/a/p from 09/13/2023 was stable. She took a break from gemcitabine in September, resumed on 10/26/2023. Tolerating it well overall still, better after the break. CT c/a/p from 11/04/2023 was stable. Today, she presents after MRI brain 01/27/2024 which shows new subinsular lesion suspicious for metastatic disease. Follow up MRI brain is planned on 02/24/2024 -- ***** agree with plans for gamma knife to this lesion. CT c/a/p upcoming on 03/02/2024. In the absence of other progression, plan to continue gemcitabine, treat ***** in the brain with GK, and then repeat scans in about 3 months.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may \"\nrepresent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. CT scans from 03/11/2023 stable to improved overall. 06/07/2023 scans stable. 09/13/2023 CT scans also stable. Now on a brief gemcitabine break around the holidays due to some cumulative fatigue but plans to restart 10/25/2023.***** the line, could consider docetaxel or potentially abraxane, request insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial focused on ***** mutations.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   -Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- doing well back on treatment after a brief treatment break around the holidays (resumed 10/26/2023) -- then held briefly around ***** in January 2024 but resuming shortly   -CT c/a/p 11/04/2023 stable   -MRI brain 01/27/2024 with new ***** in the brain  -Repeat MRI brain 02/24/2024 -- plan for GK to new metastasis  -CT c/a/p planned 03/02/2024; unless more widespread progression, plan to continue gemcitabine   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age) or abraxane; versus trial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase I trial focused on *****  -We will soon have open a trial of a *****(ON) inhibitor that looks promising, allows prior treatment with a *****(OFF) inhibitor, I would consider at time of next progression.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 not tested d/t lack of tissue, initially stage ***** s/p SBRT, now with quick metastatic bony recurrence s/p RT), with progression on carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab, on sotorasib with progression,  Subsequently started on gemcitabine.     #Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma: ***** ***** by *****. Original bx unfortunately QNS for PD-L1. April 2021 imaging showed stable disease. Severe delayed nausea with C1 requiring hospitalization was much improved with C2. Progression after C4 carbo/pemetrexed/*****. Started sotorasib 06/11/21. Interval scans with overall treatment response, although with one pleural nodule slightly increased in size (7 to 11 mm). 09/16/2021 imaging showed worsening of the ***** masslike consolidation (now 6.9x6.1 cm, previously 3.7 x 1.6 cm), A/P window node slightly increased, increased L pleural effusion but bone mets are not avid (thought may be affected by T1DM). Underwent lung biopsy on 10/19/21, ***** showed ***** ***** (and ***** mutation). Repeat CT c/a/p 11/18/21 show  decreased size of ***** mass compared to September 29 imaging, surprising given no change in treatment. Discussed at *****. Since November 2021 imaging is still substantially progressed compared to July 2021, recommendation is for change of therapy. Discussed options including single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine vs taxane) vs clinical trial vs continuing sotorasib since \"\ndisease did improve slightly from September to November. Pt has underlying neuropathy from diabetes so not a good candidate for taxane. In shared decision-making, elected to pursue gemcitabine D1/*****.    C1 week 1 with nausea, fatigue, ***** thrombocytopenia thus dose reduced ***** to 75 mg/m2 with significant improvement in symptoms.    -labs/exam appropriate today to proceed with ***** *****- will keep dose reduced at 75 mg/m2 w/ D1/***** dosing, ***** cycles  -ct c/a/p scheduled for 01/14/22 (after C2)  - seen by Dr. ***** (*****), no trials open right now but can reach out if things change   - discussed tumor banking, pt amenable but would like to sign consent in person. Study coordinator to reach out  - future tx options could include trial vs. Irinotecan. Likely not taxane given existing ***** T1DM-related neuropathy. ***** check again w/ our group on local 2nd line kras trials.    #Malignant loculated L sided pleural effusion: pleurx placed (September 29). Was initially draining 1L daily but drainage now slowing.  - effusion looks improved on most recent imaging December 01, per IR likely the reason for slowed drainage  - discussed w/ IR, plan to follow up 01/14/22 CT results and decide whether to remove pleurx based on result    #Bone mets: She underwent SBRT with Dr. ***** in 11/13/2020. Pt is edentulous.  -***** *****, will resume, renally dose- after 1 year can go to quarterly (May 2022)  -cont Ca/VitD OTC    #T1DM: Increases with dexamethasone *****.

Hypermetabolic, spiculated left upper lobe node measuring up to 2.8 cm most compatible with primary malignancy. Recommend histopathologic correlation. Hypermetabolism within the uterine fundus is nonspecific; correlate with prior imaging or dedicate pelvic ultrasound as clinically indicated.   -08/14/20 PET/CT: Enlarging aorticopulmonary window lymph node without significant hypermetabolism. While the lack of FDG avidity is reassuring, this lymph node remains indeterminate for metastatic disease; attention on follow-up. Given differences in cerebellar SUV, no significant change in hypermetabolism of primary left upper lobe mass. Slight increased size with increased surrounding groundglass opacity could reflect interval radiation therapy; correlate with history. No new sites of disease. Enhancing focus in the uterine fundus with persistent hypermetabolism compared to 06/05/2020 may represent concurrent endometrial cancer. It could be further evaluated with pelvic MRI or ultrasound as clinically indicated.  -09/08/20 Completed SBRT (50 Gy in 5 fractions)  -11/28/20 CT chest: Decreased size of left upper lobe mass with evolving post-radiation changes. New lytic lesions in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, concerning for osseous metastatic disease.  -12/05/20 PET/CT: Compared to 08/14/2020, new hypermetabolic lytic lesions in the T7 \"\nand T8 vertebral bodies, most compatible with osseous metastases. Additional hypermetabolic focus in the distal right clavicle without a definite CT correlate, which could represent an additional osseous metastasis. Recommend attention on follow-up. Decreased size and hypermetabolism of the left upper lobe primary pulmonary malignancy and aortopulmonary window lymph node. Unchanged enhancing hypermetabolic lesion in the uterine fundus, incompletely evaluated on this exam, but could represent a concurrent endometrial malignancy. Again, consider further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound or MRI if clinically indicated.   -12/12/20 MRI brain: neg  -12/24/20 ***** cfDNA: ***** *****  -01/13/412/21 Completed SBRT to T7-T8 spine, 30Gy in 5 fr  -02/27/2021 PET/CT: New hypermetabolic osseous metastases. Increased size and hypermetabolism of mediastinal lymph node, suspicious for metastasis. Slightly increased size of juxtapleural and fissural nodules in the left upper lobe, which are indeterminate for metastases. Increased cortical irregularity of the left ischial tuberosity with new enhancement and fluid in the regions of the hamstrings tendon. Findings favored to represent hamstrings tendon injury with synovitis, but recommend MRI. Continued decrease in size of primary lesion in the left upper lobe.   -03/16/2021 C1 *****/Pem/*****  -04/23/21 CT C/a/p: No significant change in size of the left upper lobe nodule with surrounding postradiation change. Similarly, a necrotic aorticopulmonary window lymph node is unchanged in size compared to prior PET/CT. No new sites of metastatic disease. Unchanged size of T7 and T8 vertebral body metastases with increased sclerosis at T7 most likely reflects healing as a response to treatment.  -05/18/21 4th and final cycle carbo/pemetrexed/*****, then stopped for progression  -06/02/21 CT c/a/p: Increasing size of level 5 lymph node, now measuring 2.4 x 2.0 cm (previously 2.1 x 1.8 cm) as well as a \"\nnodule along the major fissure on the left which now measures 0.9 x 0.6 cm (previously 0.8 x 0.3 cm). These findings are concerning for worsening metastatic disease. No new lesions identified. Sequelae of SBRT to the left upper lobe. Multiple vertebral lesions as well as a left posterior 10th rib lesion. Compared to 04/23/2021, similar lytic metastasis in the left sacrum.  -06/08/21 AST 63, ALT 76 (likely still November 11 carbo/pemetrexed/*****)  -06/11/21 Started sotorasib  -06/17/21 AST 61, ALT 71  - 07/21/21 CT chest: 1.

Decreased size of prevascular necrotic appearing node and increased sclerosis of T4 vertebral body lytic lesion; findings may represent treatment effect. Otherwise stable lytic and sclerotic osseous lesions as described above  - 07/21/21 CT AP: Overall no significant change in lytic metastasis involving the left sacrum. No new lesions within the abdomen or pelvis.  - 07/27/21: ALT 109, AST 99  -08/31/21 AST ALT normalized  -09/14/21 SMS visit: New confusion x ***** *****, ***** sat 82% RA then improved to 95% RA, new rash thought to be shingles  -09/16/21 PET/CT: Interval growth of mildly hypermetabolic left upper lobe masslike consolidation (3.7 cm to 6.9 cm, mass effect narrowing ***** bronchus) and increased size of mildly hypermetabolic prevascular mediastinal node. Findings are concerning for recurrent disease with nodal metastasis. New/significant increased size of left pleural lesions, which appear to be contiguous with the left upper lobe mass however do not demonstrate hypermetabolism. Findings remain suspicious for pleural metastasis verses loculated pleural fluid. Increased size of small left pleural effusion, suspicious for malignant effusion. Interval resolution of hypermetabolism of T7 and T8 vertebral bodies compatible with treatment response. Compared to 02/26/2021, increased size of \"\nleft sacral lesion with interval resolution of hypermetabolism. This may represent treatment response versus a false negative PET/CT. Interlobular septal thickening and groundglass opacities most predominant in the left upper lobe is favored to represent pulmonary edema due to lymphatic obstruction and likely superimposed infection/atelectasis due to narrowing and partial obstruction of the more distal left upper lobe airways.   - 09/23/21: ***** discussion- recommended biopsy given c/f disease progression  - 10/08/21-10/13/21: Admitted to UCSF after presenting w/ intractable nausea/vomiting, concurrently endorses worsening shortness of breath.                - underwent pleurx placement for recurrent *****               - October 11 MRI Brain: *****  - 10/19/21: CT guided FNA *****, path positive for adenocarcinoma. ***** pending      Interval History:  - 11/18/21 CT chest: 1.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We discussed previously that the ***** ***** mutation can be targeted with sotorasib, but that this treatment is only approved in the 2L. Dr. ***** did briefly discuss the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles \"\nappeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection, and short interval follow up CT scans in about 2 months.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. Dr. ***** had discussed these results over the phone with her and reviewed her imaging again in clinic. At this juncture we recommended changing systemic treatment. She preferred a break from infusion and visits to the city, so she started sotorasib alone. We discussed the side effects of sotorasib in detail including nausea, diarrhea, and liver injury, the latter of which rarely can be severe. Although she has tolerated it reasonably well, unfortunately today we reviewed scans from 11/09/2022 which unfortunately show progression despite sotorasib.      Finally, I discussed supportive care. In terms of symptoms, she notes slightly worse than baseline lower extremity edema, R>L and pain in ***** (R>L). She has known occlusions. ***** has been improving since stopping chemotherapy, and overall \"feels great\".    #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven \"\ninvolvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No interval imaging.  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)      None               Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial \"\noption of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it better so far. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****.     First set of restaging scans from 03/11/2023 on gemcitabine were overall stable to improved pulmonary nodules, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy and no clear new sites of disease. Single nodule in ***** may have increased slightly in size but overall improvement in disease. CT c/a/p from 06/07/2023 stable overall. Continued \"\ngemcitabine q2 weeks and will plan for next CT scans in ~12 weeks. Recent cycles tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril, ***** much improved. Olanzapine also seems to have helped nausea. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed compression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs. Diarrhea is better since stopping sotorasib.     CT c/a/p from 09/13/2023 was stable. She took a break from gemcitabine in September, resumed on 10/26/2023. Tolerating it well overall still, better after the break. Today, we reviewed images from 11/04/2023 CT c/a/p which are stable. Plan to continue gemcitabine, repeat scans in about 3 months. We will order TTE to work up pericardial effusion, moderate but increased in size from prior. She will undergo surgery for hemorrhoids in the meantime.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. CT scans \"\nfrom 03/11/2023 stable to improved overall. 06/07/2023 scans stable. 09/13/2023 CT scans also stable.

The effective dose may vary widely depending on body   size, shape, and other patient factors). Dose reduction was performed with   automated exposure control, iterative reconstruction technique and/or   adjustment of the mA and/or kV for patient size.       FINDINGS:   No evidence of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or herniation.  No extra-axial   collection.  No parenchymal edema. \"\nVisualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid   air cells are clear.                    Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + \"\n***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it better so far. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****. CT scan anticipated in the next few weeks.     Today, we discussed side effects after last cycle of gemcitabine. Headaches post-treatment have been severe and may reflect zofran side effect. I recommend switching from zofran to kytril. She has also had increased nausea, so would consider starting olanzapine 5-10 mg at bedtime as an additional anti-emetic. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed compression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs. Diarrhea is better since stopping sotorasib.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from \"\nprior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. ***** the line, could consider docetaxel, requesting insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial in phase I focused on ***** mutations.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   -Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- see is being treated locally with Dr. *****   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age); versus trial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase I trial focused on *****  -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   - Future scans locally  - CT C/A/P locally in next few weeks to assess initial response (anticipated soon)  - Recommend switching from zofran to kytril given severe headaches post-treatment, and if needed for nausea, add olanzapine 5-10 mg at bedtime      #LFT abnormalities  New transaminitis on 12/13/2022 labs. Suspect sotorasib-induced hepatotoxicity, which can be severe particularly following ***** pembrolizumab exposure. She stopped sotorasib on 12/08/2022 so hopefully that will help.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No interval imaging.  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)      None               Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to \"\ntreatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it better so far. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****.     First set of restaging scans from 03/11/2023 on gemcitabine were overall stable to improved pulmonary nodules, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy and no \"\nclear new sites of disease. Single nodule in ***** may have increased slightly in size but overall improvement in disease. Today, we reviewed CT c/a/p from 06/07/2023 which is stable overall. Continue gemcitabine q2 weeks and will plan for next CT scans in ~12 weeks. Recent cycles tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril, ***** much improved. Olanzapine also seems to have helped nausea. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed compression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs. Diarrhea is better since stopping sotorasib. I will see her back on 06/21/2023 for video visit to go over images themselves.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. CT scans from 03/11/2023 stable to improved overall. Today, we discussed 06/07/2023 scans which are stable per report; images not yet available. Continue q2 week gemcitabine for now. \"\n***** the line, could consider docetaxel, requesting insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial in phase I focused on ***** mutations.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   -Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- see is being treated locally with Dr. *****   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age); versus trial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase I trial focused on *****  -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   - Future scans locally  - CT c/a/p from 03/11/2023 looks good, overall improvement in pulmonary nodules and LN, CTM ***** nodule  - CT c/a/p from 06/07/2023 stable per report, we have requested images to confirm   - Gemcitabine is more tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril given severe headaches post-treatment, and if needed for nausea, add olanzapine 5-10 mg at bedtime    - Next CT C/A/P locally in 12 weeks    #Lower extremity edema   - Worse than baseline per patient, with pain (R>L). Not on AC per patient and chart. Follow up DVT ultrasound on 10/27/2022 without DVT.   - Compression stockings  - CTM     #Mucus membrane pemphigoid  Lesions most severe in mouth and nasal cavity, no involvement of her eyes. Histopathologically confirmed. Minimal response to rituximab on 10/29/21 and 11/05/2021, also s/p prolonged prednisone taper.  -Off prednisone altogether as of 03/19/2022 without recent flares; overall mouth symptoms are much better.   -Also now off dapsone  -Taking ***** ***** supplement   -Follow up with dermatology as scheduled and coordinate her care with them closely.     #Brain mets  One small parietal lesion concerning for a met and one in the putamen that were treated with GK on 02/26/2022. Prior MRI had a question about two cerebellar lesions that were less definitive. No changes on last MRI from 01/14/2023.  -cont MRI brain q3mo, would repeat now   - Note: Headaches recently, mild. \"\nImproves with advil/tylenol. Has hx chronic neck injuries. Some mild blurry vision, was planning to see optometrist. CTM and contact us if ***** worsens or vision changes. Suggest switching away from zofran.     #LFT abnormalities  New transaminitis on 12/13/2022 labs. Suspect sotorasib-induced hepatotoxicity, which can be severe particularly following ***** pembrolizumab exposure. She stopped sotorasib on 12/08/2022 so hopefully that will help. Now resolved.     #Tachycardia  Not clear whether this is sinus tachycardia or arrhythmia. Normal LVEF on TTE (60-65%) from 05/07/2022.  - Follow by Dr. *****, recently had ***** Patch.     #Supportive care  -SMS to *****-pal clinic for co-management (Saw SMS February 2022, ***** February 06), no follow up scheduled.  -Nutrition - Reports 2-*****/day, weight stable.  -PT referral for balance, strength training given prior *****  -Increasing work/taking on a new client in the coming weeks. Still teaching yoga classes.  -Constipation: takes senna BID PRN.  -HTN: now on losartan 100 mg daily, working with cards on anti-hypertensive regimen      RTC on 06/21/2023 to review images themselves and then in 12 weeks after restaging scans (CT c/a/p; also due for MRI brain now)     The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.      \"\n"},

Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.     Chief Complaint  Abnormal Radiology Result      History of Present Illness  ***** ***** ***** is an ***** y.o. male who is referred to interventional pulmonary clinic by Dr. ***** for evaluation L mainstem and LLL bronchial stents. Accompanied by wife *****.    Previous History:  He is well known to us and has had multiple bronchoscopies for malignant central airway obstruction due to metastatic colon cancer to distal L main bronchus. LLL bronchus debulked (April 2020) then stented (09/06/20), however, tumor grew over this site and he required recanalization with repeat stent placement (03/01/21).    CT chest May 2021 shows again complete LLL obstruction from tumor invasion.     At last visit 05/08/21, he reported that after his last airway stent placement, he developed sputum tasting like burnt seaweed which was very bothersome. CXR possible effusion. Ultrasound did not show large enough effusion for thoracentesis. Treated with Z-pack for possible PNA and foul-tasting seaweed resolved. However, couple weeks ago ***** motorcycle to 10,000 feet in ***** and became very fatigued, confused and was unable to complete ride back home; suspected hypoxia. Otherwise, no limitations in his activities: still enjoys walking the dog and remains quite active. He does continue to \"\ncough up mucous. He is using his 3% saline and ***** valve. He was about to start radiation therapy.     10/30/21  Since seeing me last, he has been hospitalized several times for staph bacteremia of unclear source.  Concern for chronic ongoing pulmonary source and thus patient was *****'d from ***** to UCSF for stent revision.  Dr. ***** removed one stent and replaced another and I appears that much of the inspissated mucous has now been coughed up.  The lung distal to the obstruction appears ***** but is now aerated and Mr. ***** is sating 98% on RA in lake tahoe today.   He continues to use 3% saline and his aerobika.  He was using ICS and is taking 3,500.  After using this recent, he coughed up several ml of bright red blood.      01/28/22  ***** off ***** on left chest and shoulder. He reports that he had a gun in the front left breast pocket so the hard impact of the ***** caused bruising over that area.     He reports some difficulty with sleeping. Has to sleep on right side to breath better. He is also having increased mucus production. Using nebulizer mounted onto ***** 3% saline BID, which helps a lot. He notes there was an additive that he was given in the hospital that smelled like eggs that really improved mucus clearance as well. But overall, he is exercising less than baseline. Continues with Care ***** treatment program, scheduled for repeat scan February 14. Continues physical therapy and continues to check ***** at home. Now it is 97%. Mild weight gain but he relates this to decrease in exercise.    No fevers, night sweats, or chills.    Hx of adenocarcinoma in colon. On IV panitumumab and maintenance dose doxy 100mg.    Interval History:   02/26/22    Patient is feeling okay. He has been recovering from his shoulder injury. He had a reverse shoulder surgery which limited his physical activity resulting in increased congestion. He has been coughing up sticky, tan colored mucus with occasional \"\nbrown streaks. He notes symptoms of mucus and runny nose began about a year ago so within the last week he started taking vitamin C which seems to be helping.     He notes being back to 4000 steps per day.      He has been experiencing cramps in his left lower rib cage area when he ***** up. Stretching his upper torso helps alleviate the cramp.

Hypermetabolic, spiculated left upper lobe node measuring up to 2.8 cm most compatible with primary malignancy. Recommend histopathologic correlation. Hypermetabolism within the uterine fundus is nonspecific; correlate with prior imaging or dedicate pelvic ultrasound as clinically indicated.   -08/14/20 PET/CT: Enlarging aorticopulmonary window lymph node without significant hypermetabolism. While the lack of FDG avidity is reassuring, this lymph node remains indeterminate for metastatic disease; attention on follow-up. Given differences in cerebellar SUV, no significant change in hypermetabolism of primary left upper lobe mass. Slight increased size with increased surrounding groundglass opacity could reflect interval radiation therapy; correlate with history. No new sites of disease. Enhancing focus in the uterine fundus with persistent hypermetabolism compared to 06/05/2020 may represent concurrent endometrial cancer. It could be further evaluated with pelvic MRI or ultrasound as clinically indicated.  -09/08/20 Completed SBRT (50 Gy in 5 fractions)  -11/28/20 CT chest: Decreased size of left upper lobe mass with evolving post-radiation changes. New lytic lesions in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, concerning for osseous metastatic disease.  -12/05/20 PET/CT: Compared to 08/14/2020, new hypermetabolic lytic lesions in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, most \"\ncompatible with osseous metastases. Additional hypermetabolic focus in the distal right clavicle without a definite CT correlate, which could represent an additional osseous metastasis. Recommend attention on follow-up. Decreased size and hypermetabolism of the left upper lobe primary pulmonary malignancy and aortopulmonary window lymph node. Unchanged enhancing hypermetabolic lesion in the uterine fundus, incompletely evaluated on this exam, but could represent a concurrent endometrial malignancy. Again, consider further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound or MRI if clinically indicated.   -12/12/20 MRI brain: neg  -12/24/20 ***** cfDNA: ***** *****  -01/13/412/21 Completed SBRT to T7-T8 spine, 30Gy in 5 fr  -02/27/2021 PET/CT: New hypermetabolic osseous metastases.

Slightly increased size of juxtapleural and fissural nodules in the left upper lobe, which are indeterminate for metastases. Increased cortical irregularity of the left ischial tuberosity with new enhancement and fluid in the regions of the hamstrings tendon. Findings favored to represent hamstrings tendon injury with synovitis, but recommend MRI. Continued decrease in size of primary lesion in the left upper lobe.   -03/16/2021 C1 *****/Pem/*****  -04/23/21 CT C/a/p: No significant change in size of the left upper lobe nodule with surrounding postradiation change. Similarly, a necrotic aorticopulmonary window lymph node is unchanged in size compared to prior PET/CT. No new sites of metastatic disease. Unchanged size of T7 and T8 vertebral body metastases with increased sclerosis at T7 most likely reflects healing as a response to treatment.  -05/18/21 4th and final cycle carbo/pemetrexed/*****, then stopped for progression  -06/02/21 CT c/a/p: Increasing size of level 5 lymph node, now measuring 2.4 x 2.0 cm (previously 2.1 x 1.8 cm) as well as a nodule along the major \"\nfissure on the left which now measures 0.9 x 0.6 cm (previously 0.8 x 0.3 cm). These findings are concerning for worsening metastatic disease. No new lesions identified. Sequelae of SBRT to the left upper lobe.

Findings are concerning for recurrent disease with nodal metastasis. New/significant increased size of left pleural lesions, which appear to be contiguous with the left upper lobe mass however do not demonstrate hypermetabolism. Findings remain suspicious for pleural metastasis verses loculated pleural fluid. Increased size of small left pleural effusion, suspicious for malignant effusion. Interval resolution of hypermetabolism of T7 and T8 vertebral bodies compatible with treatment response. Compared to 02/26/2021, increased size of left sacral lesion with \"\ninterval resolution of hypermetabolism. This may represent treatment response versus a false negative PET/CT. Interlobular septal thickening and groundglass opacities most predominant in the left upper lobe is favored to represent pulmonary edema due to lymphatic obstruction and likely superimposed infection/atelectasis due to narrowing and partial obstruction of the more distal left upper lobe airways.   - 09/23/21: ***** discussion- recommended biopsy given c/f disease progression  - 10/08/21-10/13/21: Admitted to UCSF after presenting w/ intractable nausea/vomiting, concurrently endorses worsening shortness of breath.                - underwent pleurx placement for recurrent *****               - October 11 MRI Brain: *****  -10/19/21: CT guided FNA *****, path positive for adenocarcinoma. ***** with ***** *****  - 11/18/21 CT chest: 1.

Waxing and waning groundglass opacities in the left lower lobe could represent edema, aspiration pneumonitis, and/or infection.3.  Decreased size of apical loculations of left complex pleural effusion.4.  Unchanged osseous metastases.  - 11/18/21 CT A/P: 1.  Unchanged lytic osseous metastasis.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (***** *****, PD-L1 not tested d/t lack of tissue, initially stage ***** s/p SBRT, now with quick metastatic bony recurrence s/p RT), with progression on carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab, on sotorasib with progression,  Subsequently started on gemcitabine.     #Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma: ***** ***** by *****. Original bx unfortunately QNS for PD-L1. April 2021 imaging \"\nshowed stable disease. Severe delayed nausea with C1 requiring hospitalization was much improved with C2. Progression after C4 carbo/pemetrexed/*****. Started sotorasib 06/11/21. Interval scans with overall treatment response, although with one pleural nodule slightly increased in size (7 to 11 mm). 09/16/2021 imaging showed worsening of the ***** masslike consolidation (now 6.9x6.1 cm, previously 3.7 x 1.6 cm), A/P window node slightly increased, increased L pleural effusion but bone mets are not avid (thought may be affected by T1DM). Underwent lung biopsy on 10/19/21, ***** showed ***** ***** (and ***** mutation). Repeat CT c/a/p 11/18/21 show  decreased size of ***** mass compared to September 29 imaging, surprising given no change in treatment. Discussed at *****. Since November 2021 imaging is still substantially progressed compared to July 2021, recommendation is for change of therapy. Discussed options including single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine vs taxane) vs clinical trial vs continuing sotorasib since disease did improve slightly from September to November. Pt has underlying neuropathy from diabetes so not a good candidate for taxane. In shared decision-making, elected to pursue gemcitabine D1/*****.    -s/p C1D1 gemcitabine December 04  - plts low at 88 today, will dose reduce ***** to 75 mg/m2. Labs/exam otherwise ok to proceed with ***** today  -ct c/a/p scheduled for 01/14/22 (after C2)  - upcoming 2nd opinion video visit with Dr. ***** at ***** to discuss trial options  - discuss tumor banking at next visit     #Malignant loculated L sided pleural effusion: Now has pleurX in place (September 29). Was initially draining 1L daily but drainage now slowing to 25 cc once weekly.  - effusion looks improved on most recent imaging December 01.  - encouraged pt to reach out to IR NP to discuss slowing drainage particularly given she is more symptomatic now. We will also CC her on our note.    #Bone mets: She underwent SBRT with Dr. ***** in January. Pt is \"\nedentulous.  -***** *****, will resume, renally dose- after 1 year can go to quarterly (May 2022)  -cont Ca/VitD OTC    #T1DM: Increases with dexamethasone *****.

Patient is a ***** y.o. former smoker who initially presented with weight loss in October over the preceding 5 months--reportedly 12 pounds though he loses about 10 pounds each tax season. He saw his primary care physician who recommended CT scan which revealed a mass (report not available at this time).   11/27/2015 CT-guided FNA: negative for malignancy   He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy-guided biopsy: negative for malignancy, reactive atypical cells present per chart   03/28/2016 PET/CT: ***** right upper lobe spiculated, necrotic nodule measuring 2.5x2.3cm with SUB max 4.4, appears to be directly invading the surrounding mediastinal far. Focal linear consolidation in ***** apex is not FDG avid and unchanged from prior, consistent with scarring. Stable centrilobular emphysema. Single enlarged precarinal node to 1.9x1.1cm with borderline FDG avidity, right hilar node to 1.5x1.7cm and moderately FDG avid with SUB max 3.7 with small aorticopulmonary window lymph nodes medial to left upper lobe nodule in the region of suspected mediastinal fat invasion are mostly \"\nestimate\" result, provided the serum creatinine is stable and with the following noted:                                            1. Serum creatinine level is affected by multiple factors besides GFR, including creatinine generation (which is correlated primarily with muscle mass) and renal tubular secretion of creatinine (which can be affected by certain medications). Thus, the   actual GFR for patients with poor nutritional status or limb amputation may be lower than the lower end of this range.  It may be on the higher end of this range for patients who are very muscular or take medications that decrease creatinine secretion (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, certain HIV medications).                                            2.

However, use of race in these equations is flawed for multiple reasons, including that classification of race is based on sociopolitical considerations and not justified by biology.                                            Given the above, in situations where the absolute eGFR value will directly affect clinical decision-making (e.g. medication dose or appropriateness), clinicians should consider using serum cystatin C to estimate GFR (which does not involve the   consideration of race), directly measure GFR and/or consult with nephrology.

Patient is a ***** y.o. former smoker who initially presented with weight loss in October over the preceding 5 months--reportedly 12 pounds though he loses about 10 pounds each tax season. He saw his primary care physician who recommended CT scan which revealed a mass (report not available at this time).   11/27/2015 CT-guided FNA: negative for malignancy   He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy-guided biopsy: negative for malignancy, reactive atypical cells present per chart   03/28/2016 PET/CT: ***** right upper lobe spiculated, necrotic nodule measuring 2.5x2.3cm with SUB max 4.4, appears to be directly invading the surrounding mediastinal far. Focal linear consolidation in ***** apex is not FDG avid and unchanged from prior, consistent with scarring. Stable centrilobular emphysema. Single enlarged precarinal node to 1.9x1.1cm with borderline FDG avidity, right hilar node to 1.5x1.7cm and moderately FDG avid with SUB max 3.7 with small aorticopulmonary window lymph nodes medial to left upper lobe nodule in the region of suspected mediastinal fat invasion are mostly \"\nmedications that decrease creatinine secretion (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, certain HIV medications).                                            2.

Given the above, in situations where the absolute eGFR value will directly affect clinical decision-making (e.g. medication dose or appropriateness), clinicians should consider using serum cystatin C to estimate GFR (which does not involve the   consideration of race), directly measure GFR and/or consult with nephrology.                                            Calculated using the CKD-EPI (2009) equation.  eGFR corrected for 1.73 sq meters body surface area     • eGFR - high estimate 08/22/2021 *****  >59 mL/min Final    Comment: The eGFR is likely between the \"eGFR-low estimate\" result and the \"eGFR-high estimate\" result, provided the serum creatinine is stable and with the following noted:                                            1. Serum creatinine level is affected by multiple factors besides GFR, including creatinine generation (which is correlated primarily with muscle mass) and renal tubular secretion of creatinine (which can be affected by certain medications). Thus, the   actual GFR for patients with poor nutritional status or limb amputation may be lower than the lower end of this range.  It may be on the higher end of this range for patients who are very muscular or take medications \"\nthat decrease creatinine secretion (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, certain HIV medications).                                            2.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Diagnosed in April 2016, by Dr. *****.   Patient is a ***** y.o. former smoker who initially presented with weight loss in October over the preceding 5 months--reportedly 12 pounds though he loses about 10 pounds each tax season. He saw his primary care physician who recommended CT scan which revealed a mass (report not available at this time).   11/27/2015 CT-guided FNA: negative for malignancy   He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy-guided biopsy: negative for malignancy, reactive atypical cells present per chart   03/28/2016 PET/CT: ***** right upper lobe spiculated, necrotic nodule measuring 2.5x2.3cm with SUB max 4.4, appears to be directly invading the surrounding mediastinal far.

Given the above, in situations where the absolute eGFR value will directly affect clinical decision-making (e.g. medication dose or appropriateness), clinicians should consider using serum cystatin C to estimate GFR (which does not involve the   consideration of race), directly measure GFR and/or consult with nephrology.                                            Calculated using the CKD-EPI (2009) equation.  eGFR corrected for 1.73 sq meters body surface area     • eGFR - high estimate 04/12/2021 *****  >59 mL/min Final    Comment: The eGFR is likely between the \"eGFR-low estimate\" result and the \"eGFR-high estimate\" result, provided the serum creatinine is stable and with the following noted:                                            1. Serum creatinine level is affected by multiple factors besides GFR, including creatinine generation (which is correlated primarily with muscle mass) and renal tubular secretion of creatinine (which can be affected by certain medications). Thus, the   actual GFR for patients with poor nutritional status or limb amputation may be lower than the lower end of this range.  It may be on the higher end of this range for patients who are very muscular or take medications that decrease creatinine secretion (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, certain HIV medications).                                            2.

Remaining brain parenchyma is unchanged, again demonstrating extensive sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease and tiny scattered chronic lacunar infarcts. No acute infarct, acute intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or herniation. Unchanged scattered small foci susceptibility, likely sequelae of prior treatment. Interval decrease in size of the ovoid dermal lesion within the superficial left posterior neck soft tissues, measuring 11 x 9 mm on current exam, previously \"\n13 x 16 mm, likely representing a dermal inclusion cyst. Abnormal focus of FLAIR hyperintense signal within the left anterior mandible, best seen on axial FLAIR series 800, image *****, likely odontogenic in etiology and not significantly changed. Minimal patchy mucosal ethmoid sinus disease and left mastoid effusion, both unchanged.     1.  Compared to 02/12/2021, 3 new tiny foci of abnormal parenchymal enhancement involving the right superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left cuneus. The latter two are favored new intracranial metastasis. Enhancing focus within the right superior frontal gyrus is indeterminate for metastasis versus subacute infarct, given associated reduced diffusion and background of extensive chronic white matter ischemic changes.

Serum creatinine level is affected by multiple factors besides GFR, including creatinine generation (which is correlated primarily with muscle mass) and renal tubular secretion of creatinine (which can be affected by certain medications). Thus, the   actual GFR for patients with poor nutritional status or limb amputation may be lower than the lower end of this range.  It may be on the higher end of this range for patients who are very muscular or take medications that decrease creatinine secretion (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, certain HIV medications).                                            2.

Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with history of well-controlled HIV, rectal cancer under the care of Dr. ***** s/p FOLFOX, chemo-rads (March 2018) and June (May 2019) and Stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (PD-L1 high, ***** *****+, hyper-mutated) s/p RLL wedge resection with Dr. ***** (July 2018) with biopsy confirmed metastatic recurrence in August 2019 s/p 4 cycles *****/Pem/Keytruda then  Pem/Keytruda maintenance then ipi/***** then docetaxel who presents today in follow up.      # NSCLC.     Initially diagnosed in 2019 with Stage IIIA lung adeno in setting of con-current Rectal Cancer (under the care of Dr. *****).  She underwent resection with Dr. ***** in 2019 with metastatic recurrence (b/l pulmonary nodules) in the ***** ***** *****.  It is unclear if she has metastatic involvement of her lung outside her thorax vs rectal cancer.  It is concerning that she has persistent APC and ***** ***** mutations in her blood (her lung CA is ***** *****+ and does not harbor an APC mutation).  She did quite well with 1L treatment for \"\nmetastatic lung adeno with carbo/pem/*****, but only maintained disease control for a short period on pem/***** maintenance.   We attempted to control her disease with combined CTLA4/PD1 inhibition, however scans after 2 months show complete failure to control her disease with perhaps a hyper-progressor phenotype.  This is quite disappointing given her high TMB and *****.  We discussed hospice; however she elected to pursue 2nd chemotherapy (taxane).  She has tolerated this poorly and interval imaging shows continued rapid disease progression.    We had a frank discussion today about her options.  Overall we are skeptical we can achieve significant disease control, given burden of disease and declining functional status.  Patient still wants to pursue further tumor targeted therapy and we will proceed with recently approved *****/***** ***** targeted oral agent.  We discussed potential OR rate of around 30 to 40% with potential ***** of 10 months. Luckily this is reported to be a well tolerated regimen (common AE's of diarrhea, MSK pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough).  She should avoid PPIs and H2 antagonists while on Sotorasib.  We will monitor her LFTs ***** watch for low but serious risk of ILD.  We have discussed drug-drug interactions with her HIV team and will repeat her HIV labs now. We will also get a ***** to evaluate relative burden of ***** lung cancer vs potential ***** resected rectal cancer.       I have noted that given her disease course she is unlikely to have a next line of therapeutic options and she will need to follow up closely with SMS for escalating tumor related symptoms.    # Rectal adenocarcinoma  - *****, s/p neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by June with end colostomy 08/19/2019 restaging scan demonstrating sub-diaphragmatic ***** ***** concerning for recurrence.  This have not been amenable to biopsy so far but with disease progression they may be.  However, given pace of \"\nprogression and limited treatment options for her lung CA I'm not sure if it will provide useful information.  Taxane unfortunately likely has limited activity against rectal cancer.  An alternative nth line regimen with better activity against both would be irinotecan.    #tracheal/bronchial invasion  - right middle lobe bronchus now nearly occluded, no symptoms, no hemoptysis,  - CTM closely, given overall health unlikely to benefit from stenting.    #hydro-ureter/nephrosis (moderate)  - slightly worse but unilateral.  - renal function holding steady  - again given tumor burden and pace unclear if benefit from stenting.    #LE Edema,  -Unilateral, Chronic.  Suspect relationship to prior June, rectal cancer LN involvement, ? stoma  -Repeat U/S negative for clot and demonstrates persistent edema.  -Referred to ***** clinic.  -Encourage compression stockings, elevation of leg  -Appreciate SMS assistance with pain managment,      # Colostomy and stoma hernia  - some increased swelling, pain,  - working with ***** *****, for stoma care instructions and monitoring.    # Depression and Anxiety   - continue to follow up with SMS     #HIV   - currently controlled with ***** with undetectable virus level  - repeat labs    # Neuropathy   - pt to continue current regimen with gabapentin    # Fatigue   - stable, ctm    # Supportive care. I encouraged the patient to be forthright about symptoms as they arise so they can be addressed.  We have written for home health today.      Plan:     -RTC 2-3 weeks to follow up tolerance of sotorasib  -Scans after 8 weeks  -***** now  -Check HIV labs and consider changing Stribild to Tivicay (Dolutegravir) 50 mg PO once a day and Descovy (Tenofovir *****/Emtricitabine) 25 mg-200 mg once a day PO per ID recs.    RTC 3 weeks or sooner PRN    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Method of \"\n"},

Did not discuss today.        Below for billing only       I personally reviewed and interpreted a test as summarized in the note.    I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.      Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities                  \"\nregion of suspected mediastinal fat invasion are mostly non-FDG avid. There is a 1cm lymph node directly lateral to the left common iliac artery--nonspecific and not hypermetabolic. No other evidence of metastatic disease.   04/05/2016 flexible bronchoscopy, transbronchial FNA, EBUS-trans bronchial needle aspiration: operative findings notable for a 1.8cm 10R lymph node which was biopsied. He also had narrowed airways with edema in the left upper lobe corresponding to known airway mass. Onsite cytology suggestive of adenocarcinoma of biopsies of the mass and 10R node.   Final pathology notable for: pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the mass, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lymph node. Similar cytologic features to both. *****+, Napsin A+, P40 negative.   04/16/2016 MRI brain: no evidence for metastatic disease   He has more of a cough since the initial biopsy in late November, productive of clear mucus. He had some post-procedural hemoptysis right after initial biopsy but none since. He gained about 19 pounds initially after workup began in early *****, weight peaked at 158lbs. Since then he has lost 2-4 pounds following diagnosis. No shortness of breath. He quit smoking 03/30/2016.   The patient denies any throat pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, hemoptysis, otalgia, hoarseness, globus sensation, or chronic cough.   05/07/16:   Patient has decided he wants to get treated with chemotherapy and radiation here. He has ongoing mild fatigue and cough. No other new symptoms.   06/06/16:   Started concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin/pemetrexed on 05/16/16. Had no nausea with cycle 1 but had moderate constipation from zofran, not on any opiates. Took senna 2 tabs daily, took dulcolax po prn. Has bilateral forearm rash starting a few days after cycle 1. Has had a similar rash once before to Cefaclor. No rash elsewhere. Rash has improved a little but still pruritic. No esophagitis. Here for *****.   06/27/16:   Here for *****. Took \"\ncompazine with cycle 2 instead of zofran, nausea well controlled, constipation improved. No abdominal pain this time. Last night and night before, cough with pink tinged sputum at night (was also drinking red wine). Also reports slightly blurry vision in evenings x 3-4 weeks, back to normal by morning. Notices it when watching tv. Does wear glasses for reading and midrange vision. No recent eye exam. Rash on forearms is improved with TAC.   07/18/16:   Here for C4D1 cis/pem. Completed radiation to left lung and nodes (05/17/16-07/03/16, 6600 cGy in 30 fractions). Fatigue is increasing but still tolerable. No nausea. Constipation is controlled. Using TAC daily on minimal forearm rash. Has not completed advance directive yet.   08/20/16:   Now about 1 month out from completing definitive chemotherapy and radiation. He continues to have fatigue, but is also working 12 hour days as a CPA.   CT chest/abd/pelvis on 08/15/16 shows slight decrease in size of primary tumor, and unchanged pulmonary nodules. Noted was some omental thickening, but patient still having intermitent diarrhea and constipation.   12/17/16:   Now 5 months post radiation. PET-CT shows a similar sized left upper lobe pulmonary nodule with decreased hypermetabolism.   01/28/17:   Overall stable.

My interpretation as in ***** above.    Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with history of well-controlled HIV, rectal cancer under the care of Dr. ***** s/p FOLFOX, chemo-rads (March 2018) and June (May 2019) and \"\nStage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (PD-L1 high, ***** *****+, hyper-mutated) s/p RLL wedge resection with Dr. ***** (July 2018) with biopsy confirmed metastatic recurrence in August 2019 s/p 4 cycles *****/Pem/Keytruda then  Pem/Keytruda maintenance then ipi/***** who presents today in follow up.       # NSCLC.     Initially diagnosed in 2019 with Stage IIIA lung adeno in setting of con-current Rectal Cancer (under the care of Dr. *****).  She underwent resection with Dr. ***** in 2019 with metastatic recurrence (b/l pulmonary nodules) in the ***** ***** *****.  It is unclear if she has metastatic involvement of her lung outside her thorax vs rectal cancer.  It is concerning that she has persistent APC and ***** ***** mutations in her blood (her lung CA is ***** *****+ and does not harbor an APC mutation).  She did quite well with 1L treatment for metastatic lung adeno with carbo/pem/*****, but only maintained disease control for a short period on pem/***** maintenance.   We attempted to control her disease with combined CTLA4/PD1 inhibition, however scans after 2 months show complete failure to control her disease with perhaps a hyper-progressor phenotype.  This is quite disappointing given her high TMB and *****.  She does remain adequate fitness to continue on treatment and at this time she strongly prefers to maintain an aggressive approach and is not interested in hospice care. ***** not a candidate for ***** ***** targeting agents due to concurrent HIV and rectal cancer.  SOC options ***** 2nd line chemotherapy (taxane vs gemzar), we will avoid use of ***** given invasion of main airways and risk for *****.  After discussion of risks and benefits of each regimen. Taxotere was determined to be best choice.     Feels poorly scans today to see if Taxotere is helpful. Scans showing progression in multiple sites. Discussed case with Dr *****. Need ***** 360 will arrange for home draw. Need to discuss \"\nmedication with HIV MD in ***** given interaction with Sotorasib. Call placed awaiting response.   Plan will be to check ***** for molecular drivers information.   Possibly start on  Sotorasib 960 mg po qday to ***** ***** *****. I have not ordered this as I was unable to discuss with ***** her GOC and latest scan results that show progression.     # Rectal adenocarcinoma  - *****, s/p neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by June with end colostomy 08/19/2019 restaging scan demonstrating sub-diaphragmatic ***** ***** concerning for recurrence.  This have not been amenable to biopsy so far but with disease progression they may be.  However, given pace of progression and limited treatment options for her lung CA I'm not sure if it will provide useful information.  Taxane unfortunately likely has limited activity against rectal cancer.  An alternative nth line regimen with better activity against both would be irinotecan.    #tracheal/bronchial invasion  - airways patent, no symptoms, no hemoptysis,  - CTM closely with response to chemotherapy.    #hydro-ureter/nephrosis (moderate)  - monitor sCr and response to chemotherapy.  - consider follow up U/S    #LE Edema,  -Unilateral, Chronic.  Suspect relationship to prior June, rectal cancer LN involvement, ? stoma  -Repeat U/S negative for clot and demonstrates persistent edema.  -Referred to ***** clinic.  -Encourage compression stockings, elevation of leg  -Appreciate SMS assistance with pain managment,      # Colostomy and stoma hernia  - some increased swelling, pain,  - will make sure she is connected with ***** *****, for stoma care instructions and monitoring.    # Depression and Anxiety   - continue to follow up with SMS     #HIV   - currently controlled with ***** with undetectable virus level  - immunotherapy is not contraindicated with HIV    # Neuropathy   - pt to continue current regimen with gabapentin    # Fatigue   - stable, ctm  - ***** \"\n"},

Compared to 07/28/2020, worsening intrathoracic metastatic disease including worsening lymphadenopathy and worsening pulmonary and pleural nodules. New septal thickening and peribronchovascular thickening worst in the right upper lobe suspicious for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  2.  Overall similar multifocal airway invasion by tumor with new near occlusion of the right middle lobe bronchus origin.   3.  New nonocclusive catheter associated thrombus in the superior vena cava.     CTAP 09/23/20: Widely metastatic disease, peristomal hernia, L sacral fracture, anasarca   1.  Progression of disease evidenced by increased size of centrally necrotic upper gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, three new hypoattenuating hepatic lesions suspicious for metastases, as well as numerous hyperenhancing soft tissue implants throughout the left greater than right paraspinous, iliopsoas, and obturator internus musculature.  2.  Slight increased left moderate hydroureteronephrosis and delayed left nephrogram with obstruction at the mid ureter, likely sequela of mass effect from retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  3.  Redemonstrated \"\nperistomal hernia containing a loop of transverse colon with increased dilation of the efferent loop of herniated bowel which may reflect slow passage of enteric contents. No evidence of obstruction or strangulation.  4.

Report dictated by: ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging        ***** *****+              Assessment/Plan       Metastatic lung cancer (metastasis from ***** ***** other site), unspecified laterality (CMS code)  - Disease progression both in ***** and extracranially.  - Now s/p whole brain radiation.  - S/P sotorasib, Started gemcitabine and is tolerating. His last scan was difficult to ascertain if progression happened prior to start of Gemzar  - Re-image after 3 cycles.  -Audiology referral he will call when it is the right time. Frustrated by hearing loss.   -memantine 10 mg daily s/p XRT to brain    Back Pain:   - Flexeril prn, ativan, tramadol sent rx today   -advised pt to call us if pain worsens, would do imaging sooner.     Nausea/Vomiting:  - Continue current regimen of  dexamethasone 4 mg PO daily,  and compazine 10 mg.  - Add ondansetron if needed.    Prophylaxis:  - S/P flu shot   - Recommended getting updated COVID-19 booster.         Below for billing only       I personally reviewed and interpreted a test as summarized in the note.    I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other \"\nhealthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.      Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities                  \"\nleft upper lobe nodule in the region of suspected mediastinal fat invasion are mostly non-FDG avid. There is a 1cm lymph node directly lateral to the left common iliac artery--nonspecific and not hypermetabolic. No other evidence of metastatic disease.   04/05/2016 flexible bronchoscopy, transbronchial FNA, EBUS-trans bronchial needle aspiration: operative findings notable for a 1.8cm 10R lymph node which was biopsied. He also had narrowed airways with edema in the left upper lobe corresponding to known airway mass. Onsite cytology suggestive of adenocarcinoma of biopsies of the mass and 10R node.   Final pathology notable for: pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the mass, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lymph node. Similar cytologic features to both. *****+, Napsin A+, P40 negative.   04/16/2016 MRI brain: no evidence for metastatic disease   He has more of a cough since the initial biopsy in late November, productive of clear mucus.

Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.     REASON FOR VISIT/CC: Lung Cancer   IDENTIFICATION: ***** y.o. male with ***** ***** locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma     Interval History:  Having stomach discomfort, nausea and diarrhea.   Having diarrhea every 4th day. Does not occur all day. With some episodes 2 times per day. The rest of the time has a little constipation. Can't seem to see a pattern. Uses Imodium if it occurs on   Nausea/Stomach discomfort decreased appetite. Takes compazine every 3rd or 4th day. Seems to deal with it.

No mass effect or edema with either lesion; the right superior frontal gyrus lesion also demonstrates reduced diffusion, and therefore is indeterminate from possible subacute infarct. No asymmetric perfusion, though these are likely below the resolution of ASL. Remaining brain parenchyma is unchanged, again demonstrating extensive sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease and tiny scattered chronic lacunar infarcts. No acute infarct, \"\nacute intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or herniation. Unchanged scattered small foci susceptibility, likely sequelae of prior treatment. Interval decrease in size of the ovoid dermal lesion within the superficial left posterior neck soft tissues, measuring 11 x 9 mm on current exam, previously 13 x 16 mm, likely representing a dermal inclusion cyst. Abnormal focus of FLAIR hyperintense signal within the left anterior mandible, best seen on axial FLAIR series 800, image *****, likely odontogenic in etiology and not significantly changed. Minimal patchy mucosal ethmoid sinus disease and left mastoid effusion, both unchanged.     1.  Compared to 02/12/2021, 3 new tiny foci of abnormal parenchymal enhancement involving the right superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left cuneus. The latter two are favored new intracranial metastasis. Enhancing focus within the right superior frontal gyrus is indeterminate for metastasis versus subacute infarct, given associated reduced diffusion and background of extensive chronic white matter ischemic changes.

MDM  Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities     I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or \"\ncare coordination for the diagnoses above.                    \"\nwith scarring. Stable centrilobular emphysema. Single enlarged precarinal node to 1.9x1.1cm with borderline FDG avidity, right hilar node to 1.5x1.7cm and moderately FDG avid with SUB max 3.7 with small aorticopulmonary window lymph nodes medial to left upper lobe nodule in the region of suspected mediastinal fat invasion are mostly non-FDG avid. There is a 1cm lymph node directly lateral to the left common iliac artery--nonspecific and not hypermetabolic. No other evidence of metastatic disease.   04/05/2016 flexible bronchoscopy, transbronchial FNA, EBUS-trans bronchial needle aspiration: operative findings notable for a 1.8cm 10R lymph node which was biopsied. He also had narrowed airways with edema in the left upper lobe corresponding to known airway mass. Onsite cytology suggestive of adenocarcinoma of biopsies of the mass and 10R node.   Final pathology notable for: pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the mass, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lymph node. Similar cytologic features to both. *****+, Napsin A+, P40 negative.   04/16/2016 MRI brain: no evidence for metastatic disease   He has more of a cough since the initial biopsy in late November, productive of clear mucus. He had some post-procedural hemoptysis right after initial biopsy but none since. He gained about 19 pounds initially after workup began in early *****, weight peaked at 158lbs. Since then he has lost 2-4 pounds following diagnosis. No shortness of breath. He quit smoking 03/30/2016.

PCP: ***** *****, MD    Follow up visit    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.     Chief Complaint  Follow-up      History of Present Illness  ***** ***** ***** is an ***** y.o. male who is referred to interventional pulmonary clinic by Dr. ***** for evaluation L mainstem and LLL bronchial stents. Accompanied by wife *****.    He is well known to us and has had multiple bronchoscopies for malignant central airway obstruction due to metastatic colon cancer to distal L main bronchus. LLL bronchus debulked (April 2020) then stented (09/06/20), however, tumor grew over this site and he required recanalization with repeat stent placement (03/01/21).    CT chest May 2021 shows again complete LLL obstruction from tumor invasion.     At last visit 05/08/21, he reported that after his last airway stent placement, he developed sputum tasting like burnt seaweed which was very bothersome. CXR possible effusion. Ultrasound did not show large enough effusion for thoracentesis. Treated with Z-pack for possible PNA and foul-tasting seaweed resolved. However, couple weeks ago ***** motorcycle to 10,000 feet in ***** and became very fatigued, confused and was unable to complete ride back home; suspected hypoxia. Otherwise, no limitations in his activities: still enjoys walking the dog and remains quite active. He does continue to cough up mucous. He is using his 3% saline \"\nand ***** valve. He was about to start radiation therapy.     10/30/21  Since seeing me last, he has been hospitalized several times for staph bacteremia of unclear source.  Concern for chronic ongoing pulmonary source and thus patient was *****'d from ***** to UCSF for stent revision.  Dr. ***** removed one stent and replaced another and I appears that much of the inspissated mucous has now been coughed up.  The lung distal to the obstruction appears ***** but is now aerated and Mr. ***** is sating 98% on RA in lake tahoe today.   He continues to use 3% saline and his aerobika.  He was using ICS and is taking 3,500.  After using this recent, he coughed up several ml of bright red blood.       Interval History:  ***** off ***** on left chest and shoulder. He reports that he had a gun in the front left breast pocket so the hard impact of the ***** caused bruising over that area.     He reports some difficulty with sleeping. Has to sleep on right side to breath better. He is also having increased mucus production. Using nebulizer mounted onto ***** 3% saline BID, which helps a lot. He notes there was an additive that he was given in the hospital that smelled like eggs that really improved mucus clearance as well. But overall, he is exercising less than baseline. Continues with Care ***** treatment program, scheduled for repeat scan February 14. Continues physical therapy and continues to check ***** at home. Now it is 97%. Mild weight gain but he relates this to decrease in exercise.    No fevers, night sweats, or chills.    Hx of adenocarcinoma in colon. On IV panitumumab and maintenance dose doxy 100mg.

Hypermetabolic, spiculated left upper lobe node measuring up to 2.8 cm most compatible with primary malignancy. Recommend histopathologic correlation. Hypermetabolism within the uterine fundus is nonspecific; correlate with prior imaging or dedicate pelvic ultrasound as clinically indicated.   -08/14/20 PET/CT: Enlarging aorticopulmonary window lymph node without significant hypermetabolism. While the lack of FDG avidity is reassuring, this lymph node remains indeterminate for metastatic disease; attention on follow-up. Given differences in cerebellar SUV, no significant change in hypermetabolism of primary left upper lobe mass. Slight increased size with increased surrounding groundglass opacity could reflect interval radiation therapy; correlate with history. No new sites of disease. Enhancing focus in the uterine fundus with persistent hypermetabolism compared to 06/05/2020 may represent concurrent endometrial cancer. It could be further evaluated with pelvic MRI or ultrasound as clinically indicated.  -09/08/20 Completed SBRT (50 Gy in 5 fractions)  -11/28/20 CT chest: Decreased size of left upper lobe mass with evolving post-radiation changes. New lytic lesions in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, concerning for osseous metastatic disease.  -12/05/20 PET/CT: Compared to 08/14/2020, new hypermetabolic lytic lesions in the T7 and T8 vertebral bodies, most \"\ncompatible with osseous metastases. Additional hypermetabolic focus in the distal right clavicle without a definite CT correlate, which could represent an additional osseous metastasis. Recommend attention on follow-up. Decreased size and hypermetabolism of the left upper lobe primary pulmonary malignancy and aortopulmonary window lymph node. Unchanged enhancing hypermetabolic lesion in the uterine fundus, incompletely evaluated on this exam, but could represent a concurrent endometrial malignancy. Again, consider further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound or MRI if clinically indicated.   -12/12/20 MRI brain: neg  -12/24/20 ***** cfDNA: ***** *****  -01/13/412/21 Completed SBRT to T7-T8 spine, 30Gy in 5 fr  -02/27/2021 PET/CT: New hypermetabolic osseous metastases. Increased size and hypermetabolism of mediastinal lymph node, suspicious for metastasis. Slightly increased size of juxtapleural and fissural nodules in the left upper lobe, which are indeterminate for metastases. Increased cortical irregularity of the left ischial tuberosity with new enhancement and fluid in the regions of the hamstrings tendon. Findings favored to represent hamstrings tendon injury with synovitis, but recommend MRI. Continued decrease in size of primary lesion in the left upper lobe.   -03/16/2021 C1 *****/Pem/*****  -04/23/21 CT C/a/p: No significant change in size of the left upper lobe nodule with surrounding postradiation change. Similarly, a necrotic aorticopulmonary window lymph node is unchanged in size compared to prior PET/CT. No new sites of metastatic disease. Unchanged size of T7 and T8 vertebral body metastases with increased sclerosis at T7 most likely reflects healing as a response to treatment.  -05/18/21 4th and final cycle carbo/pemetrexed/*****, then stopped for progression  -06/02/21 CT c/a/p: Increasing size of level 5 lymph node, now measuring 2.4 x 2.0 cm (previously 2.1 x 1.8 cm) as well as a nodule along the major \"\nfissure on the left which now measures 0.9 x 0.6 cm (previously 0.8 x 0.3 cm). These findings are concerning for worsening metastatic disease. No new lesions identified. Sequelae of SBRT to the left upper lobe. Multiple vertebral lesions as well as a left posterior 10th rib lesion.

Findings are concerning for recurrent disease with nodal metastasis. New/significant increased size of left pleural lesions, which appear to be contiguous with the left upper lobe mass however do not demonstrate hypermetabolism. Findings remain suspicious for pleural metastasis verses loculated pleural fluid. Increased size of small left pleural effusion, suspicious for malignant effusion. Interval resolution of hypermetabolism of T7 and T8 vertebral bodies compatible with treatment response. Compared to 02/26/2021, increased size of left sacral lesion with \"\ninterval resolution of hypermetabolism. This may represent treatment response versus a false negative PET/CT. Interlobular septal thickening and groundglass opacities most predominant in the left upper lobe is favored to represent pulmonary edema due to lymphatic obstruction and likely superimposed infection/atelectasis due to narrowing and partial obstruction of the more distal left upper lobe airways.   - 09/23/21: ***** discussion- recommended biopsy given c/f disease progression  - 10/08/21-10/13/21: Admitted to UCSF after presenting w/ intractable nausea/vomiting, concurrently endorses worsening shortness of breath.                - underwent pleurx placement for recurrent *****               - October 11 MRI Brain: *****  -10/19/21: CT guided FNA *****, path positive for adenocarcinoma. ***** with ***** *****  - 11/18/21 CT chest: 1.

Waxing and waning groundglass opacities in the left lower lobe could represent edema, aspiration pneumonitis, and/or infection.3.  Decreased size of apical loculations of left complex pleural effusion.4.  Unchanged osseous metastases.  - 11/18/21 CT A/P: 1.  Unchanged lytic osseous metastasis. No new metastases in the abdomen or pelvis.2.  Slightly increased intra and extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation without obstructing stone or mass identified.

Discussed options including single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine vs taxane) vs clinical trial vs continuing sotorasib since disease did improve slightly from September to November. Pt has underlying neuropathy from diabetes so not a good candidate for taxane. Pt and I prefer gemcitabine option. Discussed infusions on D1 and 8 with week 3 off.

Below for billing only  Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this \"\nevaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.    \"\nvertebral bodies, most compatible with osseous metastases. Additional hypermetabolic focus in the distal right clavicle without a definite CT correlate, which could represent an additional osseous metastasis. Recommend attention on follow-up. Decreased size and hypermetabolism of the left upper lobe primary pulmonary malignancy and aortopulmonary window lymph node. Unchanged enhancing hypermetabolic lesion in the uterine fundus, incompletely evaluated on this exam, but could represent a concurrent endometrial malignancy. Again, consider further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound or MRI if clinically indicated.   -12/12/20 MRI brain: neg  -12/24/20 ***** cfDNA: ***** *****  -01/13/412/21 Completed SBRT to T7-T8 spine, 30Gy in 5 fr  -02/27/2021 PET/CT: New hypermetabolic osseous metastases.

New/significant increased size of left pleural lesions, which appear to be contiguous with the left upper lobe mass however do not demonstrate hypermetabolism. Findings remain suspicious for pleural metastasis verses loculated pleural fluid. Increased size of small left pleural effusion, suspicious for malignant effusion. Interval resolution of hypermetabolism of T7 and T8 vertebral bodies compatible with treatment response. Compared to 02/26/2021, increased size of left \"\nsacral lesion with interval resolution of hypermetabolism. This may represent treatment response versus a false negative PET/CT. Interlobular septal thickening and groundglass opacities most predominant in the left upper lobe is favored to represent pulmonary edema due to lymphatic obstruction and likely superimposed infection/atelectasis due to narrowing and partial obstruction of the more distal left upper lobe airways.   - 09/23/21: ***** discussion- recommended biopsy given c/f disease progression  - 10/08/21-10/13/21: Admitted to UCSF after presenting w/ intractable nausea/vomiting, concurrently endorses worsening shortness of breath.                - underwent pleurx placement for recurrent *****               - October 11 MRI Brain: *****  -10/19/21: CT guided FNA *****, path positive for adenocarcinoma. ***** with ***** *****  - 11/18/21 CT chest: 1.

Hypertension.  Headache.       COMPARISON:   None       TECHNIQUE:   Axial CT images of the head and coronal reformatted images acquired without   contrast. Dosimetry: CTDIvol: 53.13  MGy; DLP: 850.2  MGy-cm (Note: These dose   indicators do not \"\nreflect the effective patient dose, but are metrics based on   standardized CT phantoms. The effective dose may vary widely depending on body   size, shape, and other patient factors). Dose reduction was performed with   automated exposure control, iterative reconstruction technique and/or   adjustment of the mA and/or kV for patient size.       FINDINGS:   No evidence of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or herniation.  No extra-axial   collection.  No parenchymal edema. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid   air cells are clear.                    Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L \"\ntreatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it better so far. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****.     Today, we reviewed first set of restaging scans from 03/11/2023 on gemcitabine. Overall stable to improved pulmonary nodules, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy and no clear new sites of disease. Single nodule in ***** may have increased slightly in size but overall improvement in disease. She will continue gemcitabine q2 weeks and will plan for next CT scans in 10-12 weeks. Last cycle was more tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril, ***** much improved. Olanzapine also seems to have helped nausea. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed \"\ncompression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs. Diarrhea is better since stopping sotorasib.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. CT scans from 03/11/2023 stable to improved overall. ***** the line, could consider docetaxel, requesting insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial in phase I focused on ***** mutations.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   -Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- see is being treated locally with Dr. *****   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age); versus trial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase I trial focused on *****  -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   - Future scans locally  - CT c/a/p from 03/11/2023 looks good, overall improvement in pulmonary nodules and LN, CTM ***** nodule  - Gemcitabine is more \"\ntolerable after switching from zofran to kytril given severe headaches post-treatment, and if needed for nausea, add olanzapine 5-10 mg at bedtime    - Next CT C/A/P locally in 10-12 weeks     #LFT abnormalities  New transaminitis on 12/13/2022 labs. Suspect sotorasib-induced hepatotoxicity, which can be severe particularly following ***** pembrolizumab exposure. She stopped sotorasib on 12/08/2022 so hopefully that will help. Now resolved.     #Lower extremity edema   - Worse than baseline per patient, with pain (R>L). Not on AC per patient and chart.

Imaging result in interval history above.     No interval imaging.  Last Imaging Exam  (Last 5 results in the past 30 days)      None               Assessment:     Impression: ***** y.o. female with recent diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, metastatic to axillary lymph nodes, \n here for thoracic medical oncology follow up.      We previously discussed the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma based on review of the path report from her right axillary lymph node biopsy. IHC staining and morphology most consistent with a lung primary, and she has a suspicious spiculated ***** pulmonary nodule that is the likely primary tumor. ***** NGS shows a ***** ***** mutation; PD-L1 is 10%.      We then discussed staging. Based on biopsy-proven involvement of contralateral right axillary lymph node (which counts as M1 disease), along with at least one suspected brain met, plus bilateral mediastinal LN node involvement, ***** has stage IV (*****) disease. Stage IV disease is considered incurable, but with reasonable chance of improvement in length and quality of life if it responds to treatment.     We previously noted that the standard of care in stage IV disease is systemic in nature. We briefly discussed the ***** 101 trial as a potential 1L trial option of chemo + sotorasib, but ultimately she declined this treatment option in favor of standard treatment. Not a candidate for our *****-7 trial given her MMP per trial's medical monitor. Therefore, she started carboplatin/pemetrexed + pembrolizumab 1L treatment given efficacy and less toxicity of this chemo than other regimens. CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles appeared fairly stable overall, albeit with a few areas of slightly increased interlobular septal thickening that could be lymphangitic spread, although other causes (e.g. edema) are also possible. PET/CT after 4th cycles on May 03 is stable overall, perhaps slight interval improvement from prior in discussion with UCSF radiology. She switched to pemetrexed + ***** maintenance and tolerated it okay, with some ongoing fatigue and GI side effects. CT scans from 06/22/2022 showed improvement in dominant ***** mass, left lung lymphangitic spread, and mediastinal adenopathy. \n However, there were several pulmonary nodules that are small but mildly increased in size. In discussing with UCSF radiology, these could be either infection (favored slightly) or malignancy. We treated with course of abx for possible infection.     Repeat CT C/A/P in August 2022 unfortunately showed significant and rapid progression of bilateral lung nodules compared to June scans. She switched to 2L sotorasib in September 2023 but first scans in 11/09/2022 already showed progression in lungs and LN, and she tolerated it poorly with lots of GI side effects. So she has been on gemcitabine since 12/16/2022. Tolerating it well overall. MRI brain from 01/14/2023 which shows *****.     First set of restaging scans from 03/11/2023 on gemcitabine were overall stable to improved pulmonary nodules, mediastinal/hilar adenopathy and no clear new sites of disease. Single nodule in ***** may have increased slightly in size but overall improvement in disease. CT c/a/p from 06/07/2023 stable overall. Continued gemcitabine q2 weeks and will plan for next CT scans in ~12 weeks. Recent cycles tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril, ***** much improved. Olanzapine also seems to have helped nausea. She is working with cardiology on anti-hypertensive regimen. Also discussed compression stockings for increased LE edema. She has known occlusions in arteries in legs.     CT c/a/p from 09/13/2023 was stable. She took a break from gemcitabine in September, resumed on 10/26/2023. Tolerating it well overall still, better after the break. CT c/a/p from 11/04/2023 was stable. MRI brain 01/27/2024 showed new subinsular lesion suspicious for metastatic disease. Follow up MRI brain is planned on 02/24/2024 was stable. She is s/p GK on 03/06/2024.     Today, she presents after CT c/a/p from 03/02/2024 which shows mild improvement in some of the pulmonary metastases, otherwise stable disease. Agree with continuing gemcitabine with plan to repeat scans in about 3 \n months.     #Lung adenocarcinoma  ***** ***** on *****, PD-L1 10%. Stage IV disease (*****) given biopsy-proven involvement in contralateral axillary lymph node, which counts as M1 disease, along with now two small suspected brain metastasis. She has good performance status despite her age, so we are being aggressive with treatment.  CT scans from 03/30/2022 after 2 cycles show stable measurable disease, but with a few areas of interlobular septal thickening that are slightly increased from prior and should be monitored as they may represent areas of lymphangitic spread/early progression. PET/CT from 05/03/2022 after 4th cycle shows stable to improved disease overall. CT June 22 showed interval improvement in ***** primary tumor and adenopathy, but increase in size of multiple small scattered pulmonary nodules (infection vs malignancy)- treated with 7 days of levaquin. 09/03/22 CT C/A/P showed disease progression in bilateral pulmonary nodules. Started sotorasib in September 2022 but unfortunately first scan from 11/09/2022 shows ongoing cancer *****. Now doing well on gemcitabine. CT scans from 03/11/2023 stable to improved overall. 06/07/2023 scans stable. 09/13/2023 CT scans also stable. Now on a brief gemcitabine break around the holidays due to some cumulative fatigue but ***** as of 10/25/2023. CT scans 03/02/2024 show a partial response. MRI brain 01/27/2024 and 02/24/2024 with new brain met, now s/p GK SRS on 03/06/2024.     ***** the line, could consider docetaxel or potentially abraxane, request insurance authorization for ipi/***** versus a clinical trial focused on ***** mutations. Could consider retrial of adagrasib but had primary progression to sotorasib previously.      -Stopped sotorasib given progression   -Continue gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 q2 week dosing for now -- doing well back on treatment after a brief treatment break around the holidays (resumed 10/26/2023) -- then held briefly around ***** in January 2024 but \n resuming shortly   -CT c/a/p 11/04/2023 stable   -MRI brain 01/27/2024 with new ***** in the brain  -Repeat MRI brain 02/24/2024 -- s/p GK to new metastasis on 03/06/2024   -CT c/a/p 03/02/2024 with ongoing response   - Continue gemcitabine   -Future lines of tx include docetaxel monotherapy (might avoid VEGF inhibitor given her age) or abraxane; versus trial of ipilimumab/nivolumab versus phase I trial focused on *****  -We will soon have open a trial of a *****(ON) inhibitor that looks promising, allows prior treatment with a *****(OFF) inhibitor, I would consider at time of next progression. Or we have a trial of adagrasib + a RAF/MEK clamp.   -Discussed plan with her local oncologist Dr. *****   -Future scans locally in about 3 months (May 2024)   -Gemcitabine is more tolerable after switching from zofran to kytril given severe headaches post-treatment, and if needed for nausea, add olanzapine 5-10 mg at bedtime   -TTE with small pericardial effusion on 01/24/2024 CTM periodically     #Lower extremity edema   - Worse than baseline per patient, with pain (R>L).

Histopathologically confirmed. Minimal response to rituximab on 10/29/21 and 11/05/2021, also s/p prolonged prednisone taper in the past. Now essentially in a remission. ***** to be a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with cancer.   -Off prednisone altogether as of 03/19/2022 without recent flares; overall mouth symptoms are much better with treating her cancer  -Also now off dapsone  -Taking ***** ***** supplement   -Follow up with dermatology in one year (around June 2024)      #Brain mets  One small parietal lesion concerning for a met and one in the putamen that were treated with GK on 02/26/2022. Prior MRI had a question about two \n cerebellar lesions that were less definitive. No changes on MRI from 07/28/2023. Brain MRI 01/27/2024 with new *****, agree with plans for GK.   -Agree with GK to new brain met on 01/27/2024 scan   -cont MRI brain q3mo at least  - Note: Headaches recently, mild. Improves with advil/tylenol. Has hx chronic neck injuries. Some mild blurry vision, was planning to see optometrist. CTM and contact us if ***** worsens or vision changes. Improved with switching away from zofran.     #LFT abnormalities  Transaminitis on 12/13/2022 labs. Suspect sotorasib-induced hepatotoxicity, which can be severe particularly following ***** pembrolizumab exposure. She stopped sotorasib on 12/08/2022 so hopefully that will help. Now resolved.     #Tachycardia  Not clear whether this is sinus tachycardia or arrhythmia. Normal LVEF on TTE (60-65%) from 05/07/2022.  - Follow by Dr. *****, recently had ***** Patch.     #Supportive care  -SMS to *****-pal clinic for co-management (Saw SMS February 2022, ***** February 06), no follow up scheduled. Doing well right now.   -Nutrition - Reports 2-*****/day, weight stable.  -Increasing work/taking on a new client in the coming weeks. Still teaching yoga classes.  -Constipation: takes senna BID PRN.  -HTN: now on losartan 100 mg daily, working with cards on anti-hypertensive regimen      RTC in early June restaging scans locally or earlier as needed for new symptoms      The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient’s satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of 30 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, \n family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is in a UCSF clinical facility.        \n"}
